Some of the most prominent projects that preceded Bitcoin include: Digicash, b-money, Hashcash, e-gold, and Bit Gold. Bitcoin is often associated with Austrian economic theories, anarcho-capitalist principles, and general libertarian politicking by virtue of the exclusive developer community to whom Nakamoto first released their white paper, certain protocol design characteristics, and the political affiliations of early Bitcoin investors. \n\nConception to Launch\nOn October 31, 2008, at the peak of the Global Financial Crisis, just six weeks after the infamous investment bank, Lehman Brothers, declared bankruptcy, the pseudonymous \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/satoshi-nakamoto\"\u003eSatoshi Nakamoto\u003c/a\u003e released the Bitcoin whitepaper to the cryptography mailing list. Titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System\", the whitepaper proposed a new electronic cash system that would allow fully peer-to-peer online payments without reliance on trusted third parties. Soon after the release of the whitepaper, Satoshi implemented the Bitcoin software as open-source code. On 3 January 2009, the Bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi mining the genesis block of Bitcoin, which included a now-famous \"The Times\" headline in the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/coinbase-transaction\"\u003ecoinbase\u003c/a\u003e both to prove the network’s fair launch and to make a political statement about the global financial system. The event marked the birth of the world's first non-sovereign, decentralized, digital money.\n\nPost Launch\n\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/hal-finney\"\u003eHal Finney\u003c/a\u003e, who invented the first reusable proof-of-work system (RPoW) in 2004, received the first Bitcoin transaction (10 bitcoins) on January 12, 2009. In 2010, the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/laszlo-hanyecz\"\u003eLaszlo Hanyecz\u003c/a\u003e bought two Papa John's pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins. \n\nIn August 2010, a major vulnerability in the Bitcoin protocol was spotted and exploited in the Bitcoin network, allowing users to create an infinite amount of bitcoins. The transactions exploiting the vulnerability were quickly spotted and erased for the Bitcoin blockchain, with the vulnerability being patched in a network upgrade of the Bitcoin protocol. This was the only major security flaw found and exploited in Bitcoin's history.\n\nIn December 2010, amidst rising publicity from Bitcoin's use in financing Wikileaks, Satoshi Nakamoto, disappeared from involvement with Bitcoin. It is unknown why Satoshi disappeared from the project, although some believe Satoshi, cognizant of past struggles to launch a digital currency, recognized that a leader of the Bitcoin project could be a central point of failure. It is estimated that Nakamoto had mined about one million bitcoins before disappearing in 2010 when he handed the network alert key and control of the code repository over to \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/gavin-andresen\"\u003eGavin Andresen\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nSilk Road \u0026 Mt. Gox\nOne of the most iconic early use cases for Bitcoin was the Silk Road. Launched in early 2011, the Silk Road was a darknet marketplace that allowed users to buy and sell a wide variety of goods including, most notably, illegal drugs. Underpinning the Silk Road was the Tor network, which allowed users to browse the Silk Road anonymously and securely without potential traffic monitoring, and Bitcoin which provided a censorship-resistant payment rail for pseudonymous transactions. Over the course of its life, it is estimated that the Silk Road facilitated more than $1.2 billion in transactions, collecting over $80 million in sales commissions, leveraging the Bitcoin network as its payment rail. The site was shut down in 2013 when the FBI took advantage of the Silk Road’s centralized infrastructure, arresting founder \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/ross-ulbricht\"\u003eRoss Ulbricht\u003c/a\u003e, and shuttering the site.\n\nFounded by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/jed-mccaleb\"\u003eJed McCaleb\u003c/a\u003e in July 2010, and led by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/mark-karpeles\"\u003eMark Karpeles\u003c/a\u003e until it collapsed, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/mtgox\"\u003eMt. Gox\u003c/a\u003e was one of the earliest Bitcoin exchanges in the world. Based in Tokyo, Japan, the exchange would go on to handle over 70% of all bitcoin (BTC) transactions worldwide at its peak. Known for its chronic security issues, Mt. Gox was infamously hacked in 2014, losing 850,000 bitcoins worth about $450 million at the time. The hack sent the price of Bitcoin, which was in the midst of one of its first major price bubbles, plummeting. Bitcoin would sink into a bear market with prices not recovering until the 2017 bull run.\n\n2017 Bubble \u0026 Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork\nThe 2017 price bubble was a watershed moment for Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin rose more than 1900% from just under $1,000 at the beginning of the year to near $20,000 at its peak in December. At its peak, Bitcoin's market capitalization eclipsed $325 billion. Along with the proliferation of Initial Coin Offerings, powered by Ethereum, Bitcoin's incredible 2017 run propelled cryptocurrency into mainstream consciousness, among the most discussed phenomena of 2017.\n\nAlso notable in 2017, Bitcoin experienced its \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork\"\u003emost contentious fork to date\u003c/a\u003e. Amidst rising transaction fees on Bitcoin and increasingly divergent views on scaling Bitcoin, an agreement was reached amongst prominent Bitcoin stakeholders in what is now known as the \"New York Agreement\". The agreement was to support a set of network upgrades called SegWit2x. The proposal was backed by over 80% of Bitcoin's hash rate. However, despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/segregated-witness\"\u003eSegWit\u003c/a\u003e without the 2MB block size increase, the philosophy underpinning this decision being that the users controlled the network, not miners and Bitcoin businesses. Subsequently, they set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would soft fork to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Enough nodes signaled support for it that they forced miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. A faction of the bigger blocks camp, rejected SegWit altogether, citing frustrations with the prioritization of SegWit over bigger blocks, and on August 1, 2017, they launched a hard fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash, with 8MB block limits. These events marked, one end, a landmark demonstration of power by the users of the Bitcoin network, and on the other end, the first great schism within the Bitcoin community.\n\n2018 - 2019\nAfter peaking in December 2017, Bitcoin, along with the rest of the cryptocurrency market in January 2018, crashed, sending the cryptocurrency market into its latest bear market. Since then Bitcoin has dropped as low as $3,200, more than 80% below its ATH. However, while prices have yet to recover to 2017 highs, the institutionalization of Bitcoin has picked up significantly. Traditional Wall Street institutions including Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Intercontinental Exchange, and Fidelity have all launched cryptocurrency offerings, opening up the market to institutional investors. There are now several regulated exchanges and custodians. Furthermore, regulatory clarity around Bitcoin has improved dramatically with SEC Chairman, Jay Clayton, revealing at a Congressional hearing in February 2018, that the SEC does not consider Bitcoin to be a security.\n\nSince it reached its cycle low in February 2019, Bitcoin's price has recovered considerably, rising as high as $13,000 in June. With the recent announcements of Facebook's Libra project and China's Central Bank digital currency, governments and multinational corporations around the world have begun to look at cryptocurrencies more seriously. American officials are debating a digital dollar and lawmakers around the world are considering the central bank digital currency (CBDC) options. Furthermore, there have been numerous cryptocurrency-related hearings since Libra was announced. China has recently \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/china-blockchain-madness\"\u003eannounced\u003c/a\u003e blockchain was a revolutionary technology and that it would make blockchain technology a strategic imperative for the country. Bitcoin's price rose more than 40% after the announcement, its highest intraday movement since 2011.\n\n2020 - 2021\nBitcoin traded sideways into 2020, but the onset of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic saw world markets take the biggest dips since at least the 2007-08 Mortgage Crisis. Bitcoin did not escape the dip – in less than 48 hours it lost half of its value, going below $4,000 for the first time since March of 2019. Luckily for bitcoiners, bitcoin rebounded, returning to its pre-pandemic price in less than a month.\n\nBitcoin’s ascent recovery out of the March turmoil drew wider media and institutional attention and lent credibility to its store of value narrative. Although it remained around $10,000 throughout Ethereum’s firey \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/a-data-driven-look-at-the-end-of-defi-s-summer\"\u003eDeFi summer\u003c/a\u003e, bitcoin would start to trend upwards into the fall and by early November bitcoin hit $14,000. Whether it was unprecedented levels of money printing by the Federal Reserve, its V-shaped recovery in April, or direct stimulus payments to millions of Americans, it was clear bitcoin wasn’t done at $14,000 as it crossed $20,000 for the first time ever on December 16, 2020. Two weeks later it hit $28,000. Then, on January 8, 2021, bitcoin set a new all-time high of $41,429.38. Since hitting $41,000 bitcoin has mostly drifted in the $30,000.\n\nBitcoin’s price wasn’t the only thing rapidly accelerating in 2020. Institutional adoption skyrocketed. Led by Paul Tudor Jones of Microstrategy (  $1 billion), institutions joined the bitcoin world en masse. From insurance companies like MassMutual ($100 million) to investment firms like Ruffer ($744 million) new groups \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/the-potential-impact-of-increased-capital-allocation-to-bitcoin\"\u003econtinue\u003c/a\u003e to adopt bitcoin. And institutions aren’t alone – entrepreneurs like Elon Musk and politicians like Miami Mayor Francis Suarez have increasingly promoted bitcoin. Even athletes have joined the space, as NFL player Russell Okung partnered with Bitcoin Lightning Company \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/zap\"\u003eZap\u003c/a\u003e to become the first professional sports player ever to be paid in bitcoin\n\n","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Whitepaper","date":"2008-10-31T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper"},{"title":"Genesis Block","date":"2009-01-03T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Bitcoin's genesis block is mined"},{"title":"M-of-N Standard Transactions","date":"2011-10-02T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"BIP 011 implemented M-of-N-signatures required transactions as a new 'standard' transaction type.

Users (full nodes) adopt new rules according to their subjective views on what Bitcoin is and should be. If two or more individuals adopt the same set of rules, they form an inter-subjective social consensus of what “Bitcoin” is. It is in this respect that many conceptualize Bitcoin as being set by a social contract. Every time rule changes are contemplated, the rules of the contract are decided and renegotiated continuously between stakeholders. Protocol changes are legitimized when users agree to adopt the new changes. Once adopted, the Bitcoin protocol automates the enforcement of the social contract.\n\nProcess Overview\nProtocol development is governed by a proposal process whereby anyone in the open-source Bitcoin community can submit \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip\"\u003eBitcoin Improvement Proposals\u003c/a\u003e (\"BIPs\"). After debate by the community, when consensus has emerged, the Bitcoin Core maintainers merge code changes into Bitcoin Core's GitHub Repository. Once new code has been implemented into the Bitcoin Core client, users of the network (full nodes) must be persuaded to adopt the new changes. Protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus.\n\nOnce rules are adopted on-chain, all new transactions and block proposals are subject to the agreed-upon rules. Full nodes only accept new transactions and block proposals that are valid according to the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. Anything that is not valid will be rejected. Thus, miners must implement the prevailing rules of the network in order to participate in the block creation process. \n\nUser Activated Hard Fork\n2017's \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-cash-hard-fork\"\u003eUser Activated Soft Fork Event\u003c/a\u003e provided an illustrative case study on Bitcoin governance in practice. \n\nAs early as 2010, shortly after Satoshi implemented a block limit into Bitcoin, discussions around block size began. These discussions largely stayed in the background until 2017 when tensions within the Bitcoin community rose over rising transaction fees and increasingly divergent opinions on scaling Bitcoin. In May 2017, a meeting between miners, businesses, investors, and core developers took place at the Consensus conference in New York, in what is now referred to as the \"New York Agreement\". The product of this meeting was an agreement to support \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/segregated-witness\"\u003eSegWit\u003c/a\u003e (a soft fork) and a 2MB block size (hard fork). \n\nKnown as SegWit2x, this proposal was backed by over 80% of the network’s hash rate. However, despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate SegWit without the block size increase. This plan was proposed as BIP 148, a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal, from a pseudonymous developer named \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/shaolin-fry\"\u003eShaolinfry\u003c/a\u003e. Soon after, users set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would soft fork to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Eventually, enough nodes signaled support for it, forcing miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. \n\nMany see this user-activated soft fork (UASF) as a pivotal moment in Bitcoin’s history. The philosophy underpinning the event was that users controlled the network, not miners. The event not only illustrated the balance of power within Bitcoin's network, but also calmed suspicions that parties such as miners, businesses, or Bitcoin Core developers, controlled Bitcoin.

Buterin published the first Ethereum white paper later that year, describing a distributed computing platform for executing smart contracts and building \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/decentralized-applications-dapps\"\u003edecentralized applications (dApps)\u003c/a\u003e. In 2014, Buterin and some other early contributors founded the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ethereum-foundation\"\u003eEthereum Foundation\u003c/a\u003e, a non-profit organization dedicated to Ethereum’s research, core protocol development, and ecosystem growth. The foundation's first task was to host the Ethereum crowdsale, which raised 31,529 \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\"\u003eBTC\u003c/a\u003e (~$18 million at the time) in exchange for about 60 million ether, and use the proceeds to fund the network's initial development. The Ethereum Foundation continues to be the primary funding organization, issuing grants to research teams and projects focused on Ethereum.\n\nThe rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs)\nEthereum's mainnet launched in July 2015, with the first live release known as Frontier. Shortly thereafter, Augur (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/augur\"\u003eREP\u003c/a\u003e) conducted the first \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/initial-coin-offering-ico\"\u003eInitial Coin Offering (ICO)\u003c/a\u003e, in which the startup sold its Ethereum-based REP tokens (created via the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/erc-20\"\u003eERC-20\u003c/a\u003e standard) to help fund the project. The ability to develop and sell a newly generated token to help raise capital became an attractive method of fundraising because projects could circumvent the legal policies and costs required from traditional companies (until more recently). Ethereum-focused startups created thousands of new tokens since Augur's ICO, raising billions of dollars in the process.\n\nThe DAO hack\nIn April 2016, a decentralized venture fund known as \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/the-dao\"\u003eThe DAO\u003c/a\u003e hosted an ICO, raising ~$150 million in ETH in the process. A few months later (July 2016), an attacker exploited a bug in one of The DAO's smart contracts, enabling the guilty party to siphon 3.6 million ETH. A significant portion of the Ethereum community opted to revert the chain to remove The DAO and its subsequent hack from the network's history. The remaining stakeholders held the preservation of immutability in higher regard and refused to accept a ledger rewrite. The divide in the community led to a contentious hard fork a few weeks post-hack, causing a permanent split in the network. The legacy chain that did not reverse its transaction history is now known as Ethereum Classic (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum-classic\"\u003e$ETC\u003c/a\u003e).\n\nThe path to scalability: Ethereum 2.0\nScalability is a known limitation for the current state of Ethereum. Periods of high user activity, as seen during the CryptoKitties launch in Nov. 2017 and the DeFi bonanza during the Summer of 2020, can cause transaction times and fees to skyrocket, which often prices out retail users and newcomers.\n\nThe potential shortcomings of Ethereum's current design are nothing new to Ethereum developers. Various teams have been working since the launch of Ethereum to upgrade the network to account for better scalability and security measures without compromising the community's values of decentralization. The current plan is to swap Ethereum's consensus layer from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and implement a scaling technique known as sharding in a massive upgrade called Serenity (also referred to as Ethereum 2.0).\n\nEthereum developers have broken down this upgrade into three or more phases to minimize complexity as they add more features. The first phase Phase 0 has a minimum launch date of Dec. 1, 2020. It will bring the Beacon Chain (the backbone of Ethereum 2.0) to life and enable the network to bootstrap a stable of validators to ensure network security. The following phases are being developed in parallel but might take several years before they reach completion.","issuing_organizations":[{"slug":"ethereum-foundation","name":"Ethereum Foundation","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/DOnqq1OM_400x400.jpg","description":"Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference."}]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Olympic","date":"2015-05-01T04:00:00Z","type":"Testnet Launch","details":"Olympic was the final Ethereum proof-of-concept released before mainnet launch.

The Frontier launch enabled miners to start receiving real ETH as a reward for their efforts, with the initial block subsidy consisting of five ETH per valid block. Version 1.0 also featured a hardcoded gas limit of 5000 gas per block to prevent any issues with node installation. The gas limit lasted only a few days post-launch before being automatically removed. To avoid unwanted chain forks, Frontier contained Canary contracts as well. Canary contracts gave Ethereum core developers the ability to stop specific operations or transactions before a miner wandered off to an orphaned chain.

Ethereum core developers split Istanbul into two phases because two of the EIPs up for discussion require extensive testing and development before launch. At the moment, core devs have approved and raised two EIPs to accepted status. There are two other proposed EIPs that may be ready in time for Berlin.\n\nAccepted\nEIP-2315 implements simple subroutines for the EVM which could lower gas costs and make states analysis easier\nEIP 2537 (which superseded EIP-1962) implements a single BLS curve to make it easier to deploy and manage rollup contracts and zk-SNARKs/STARKs\n\nProposed\nEIP-2046 reduces the gas cost for static calls made to precompiled contracts\nEIP-2565 will re-price the ModExp precompile (EIP-198) to enable more cost-efficient verification of RSA signatures, verifiable delay functions (VDFs), and primality checks, among other functions\n\nIstanbul Phase II notably excludes any EIPs related to the difficulty bomb (i.e., the Ethereum \"ice age\"). The core developers concluded, \"there's no major reason do it now\" because the difficulty bomb is only necessary once Ethereum 2.0 and its Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism are activated. Overlooking an Ice Age EIP for now also prevents any further delays in Berlin's development phase.\n\nCore devs and the greater Ethereum community also excludes the EIP-1057, the proposal for the now-infamous ProgPoW (short for Progressive Proof-of-Work). It aimed to alter Ethereum's hashing algorithm to close the performance efficiency gap between generalized and specialized mining hardware (otherwise known as ASICs). While GPU miners and some core devs favored the proposal, many in the community were vehemently against it. Therefore, all sides agree to a href=\"https://messari.io/article/progpow-wars-ethereum-dev-call-places-a-spotlight-on-the-progpow-debate\"not include ProgPoW/a in any upcoming forks as no protocol changes are worth triggering a network split\n\nLearn more:\nBerlin EIPs spreadsheet"},{"title":"Serenity Phase 0","date":"2020-12-01T00:00:00Z","type":"Network Launch","details":"Serenity Phase 0 marks Ethereum's initial transition to Ethereum 2.0.

The specifications for this first phase include:\nBeacon Chain is the core of the Ethereum 2.0 system; it manages the PoS protocol for itself and all of the individual shard chains.

Those block rewards incentivize miners to secure the network. Miners that find an uncle block also receive 87.5% of the base block reward. Uncle blocks occur when several distinct miners simultaneously mine a block. In this case, the block that has the most accumulated PoW is conserved, and others are rejected. Unlike the Bitcoin chain that does not reward miners for orphan blocks, the Ethereum chain does reward uncle block miners. Transaction fees, however, are not awarded to uncle block miners. As \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\"\u003eVitalik Buterin\u003c/a\u003e notes, the initial intent behind rewarding uncle block miners was to avoid mining centralization caused by the network lag that smaller miners could endure:\n  \"This mechanic was originally introduced to reduce centralization pressures, by reducing the advantage that well-connected miners have over poorly connected miners.\"\n\nIn 2017, the difficulty bomb increased block times drastically, thus reducing the issuance rate. Indeed, the difficulty bomb, also known as \"ice age\" was initially designed as a mechanism to disincentivize miners to continue mining the Ethereum chain by making it exponentially harder to create a new block. This was meant to accelerate the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake.\n\nThe Casper development and transition to Proof-of-Stake being delayed, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\"\u003eVitalik Buterin\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/afri-schoedon\"\u003eAfri Schoeden\u003c/a\u003e proposed to delay the difficulty bomb and reduce the block rewards from 5 Ether to 3 Ether, thus leaving the system in the same general state as before. This proposal, EIP 649, was included in the Byzantium hard fork which was implemented on October 16, 2017, at block 4,370,000, thus effectively reducing block rewards from 5 Ether to 3 Ether and delaying the difficulty bomb for approximately 1.4 years.\n\nOn February 28, 2019, at block 7,280,000, the Constantinople hard fork further reduced block rewards from 3 Ether to 2 Ether, and once again delayed the difficulty bomb for approximately 12 months with EIP 1234.\n\nThe Ethereum's Parity multi-sig wallet bug\n\nOn November 06, 2017, a vulnerability in the \"library\" smart contract code was exploited by an anonymous user. Subsequently, the user destroyed the library contract. This destruction locked forever a total amount of 513,774.16 Ether located in 587 multi-signatures parity wallets. \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/messari-proprietary-methods\"\u003eMessari Proprietary Methodology\u003c/a\u003e to calculate liquid supply excludes any non-transferable coins. Thus, these locked Ether are considered illiquid and are not included in our liquid supply calculation.\n\nETH 2.0 and the transition to Casper Proof-of-Stake\n\nIn ETH 2.0, the Ethereum chain will be maintained via a new proof-of-stake system, where rewards will be distributed on a sliding scale based on the total amount staked on the network. The more total supply that’s staked, the higher the system-wide issuance rate (to incentivize high cumulative participation). Although individual yields will decline as the staking participation increases. A table posted by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/vitalik-buterin\"\u003eVitalik Buterin\u003c/a\u003e on Github lays out the sliding scale issuance rate. \n\n\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/justin-drake\"\u003eJustin Drake\u003c/a\u003e, a researcher at the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ethereum-foundation\"\u003eEthereum Foundation\u003c/a\u003e, argued that targeting 30,000,000 ETH at stake, long-term, “seems about right for strong security.” It would represent about 30% of the network and result in an approximate 3% annual inflation. Nevertheless, the penalties applied to validators going offline as well as the slashing penalties and the transaction fees burnt due to EIP 1559 will lead to the destruction of Ether, thus reducing the total net issuance amount.\n\nThe transition to Proof-of-Stake will occur in three or four stages, according to the latest specifications shared by the core developers:\nPhase 0, expected for Dec. 1, 2020, will initially increase issuance compared to the current level. This is due to the fact that both the Proof-of-Work and Beacon Chain will run simultaneously and rewards will be distributed on both chains, although the staking participation, and thus annual issuance on the Beacon Chain, will most likely be very low during this Phase.\nPhase 1, expected for Q4 2021, will allow finalizing the Proof-of-Work chain with Proof-of-Stake. The Proof-of-Work rewards will most likely be reduced to match an issuance rate between 0.5% and 1% (versus 4.5% before Phase 1). Both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake rewards will co-exist and the global issuance rate should be around 1% at that stage.\nPhase 1.5, estimated for 2022, will mark when Ethereum 2.0 transfers will likely unlock, giving stakers access to their previously inaccessible staked ETH and accumulated rewards. These rewards and staking amounts will date back to the launch of the Beacon Chain.\nPhase 2, estimated for 2023, will progressively lead to an increase of staking participation, thus increasing the annual issuance rate, while Proof-of-Work will simultaneously progressively disappear.\n\n","general_emission_type":"Inflationary","precise_emission_type":"Fixed Issuance","is_capped_supply":false,"max_supply":null},"consensus":{"consensus_details":"Modified GHOST protocol\nThe Ethereum White Paper states Ethereum uses a modified version of the \"Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree\" (GHOST) protocol to distinguish the \"longest\" base chain (the chain with the most accumulated Proof-of-Work backing it) from forks. \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/nakamoto-consensus\"\u003eNakamoto Consensus\u003c/a\u003e, the implementation used by Bitcoin (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\"\u003e$BTC\u003c/a\u003e) and its forks, is problematic in networks with fast confirmation times (i.e., block times) like Ethereum. Quick block times lead to a higher stale or orphan rate, which can split mining resources among competing forks and reduce overall network security. Accelerated confirmation times also increases the likelihood a single mining pool could obtain a majority of the hashpower on a given chain.\n\nThe GHOST protocol attempts to solve this issue of network security by including orphan blocks in the calculation of the longest chain. Therefore, the GHOST model determines the valid chain by weighing the parent and further ancestors as well as the number of stale descendants. The protocol also rewards the mining of orphan blocks directly connected to the longest chain to combat potential centralization concerns. Orphan block miners do not receive any transaction fees, only a portion of the block subsidy, as stale transactions are not considered valid.\n\nSome say GHOST works better in theory than in practice, claiming Ethereum further modified its consensus implementation before (or soon after) launch to avoid security complications. Others suggest the Ethereum consensus model better resembles Nakamoto consensus or a modified version of the Inclusive protocol. But the inclusion of EIP-100 in the Byzantium fork changed Ethereum's difficulty calculation algorithm to include orphan blocks, which indicates the proposed modified GHOST implementation is intact. Regardless of the security model classification, Ethereum continues to reward orphan block miners with 87.5% of the base block reward.\n\nMining\nEthereum miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks by running the Ethash \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\"\u003eProof-of-Work (PoW)\u003c/a\u003e algorithm. In this process, miners compete to discover a valid hash, using the Keccak-256 and Keccak-512 hash functions, as defined by Ethereum's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Unlike Bitcoin's biweekly adjustments, Ethereum recalculates its difficulty level every block based on the time between the two previous blocks.\n\nCryptographers designed Ethash to be \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics\"\u003eASIC\u003c/a\u003e-resistant by making it memory intensive for specialized mining chips. But the popularity of Ethereum led mining chip manufacturer Bitmain to release the first ASICs miners for Ethash in April 2018. The majority of the Ethereum remains opposed to ASIC miners, as evidenced by its support for the ProgPoW EIP (a likely inclusion in the second Istanbul hard fork).

Every operation on the EVM requires computational effort and memory. Ethereum node operators and miners provide these scarce resources to application developers and network users in exchange for gas. Different operations require different amounts of gas, and the user can specify how much they are willing to pay in ETH for each unit of gas. The amount of gas required for the transaction, along with the price paid, becomes the transaction cost. Every transaction also had a gas limit to prevent attacks from overloading blocks, which could slow down block production.\n\nDeveloper tools and token standards\nEthereum adopted \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/erc-20\"\u003eEthereum Request for Comment (ERC) 20\u003c/a\u003e in late 2015 as a standard for Ethereum smart contracts to issue tokens on the platform. The majority of tokens built on Ethereum are ERC-20 compliant, meaning they follow a standard set of rules defining how they are created and used. Another more popular token rule set is ERC-721 with standardizes the issuance of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) where any given token is distinguishable from another making them popular for gaming.\n\nEthereum 2.0\nAs Ethereum transitions to Eth 2.0, it will undergo significant changes to its design. It will transition from \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\"\u003eProof-of-Work\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-stake\"\u003eProof-of-Stake\u003c/a\u003e and feature a sharding architecture. Currently, nodes must validate every transaction to maintain an updated global state. The new sharding model segments the network into various groups (called shards) and randomly assigns nodes to each shard. Rather than having to monitor the entire chain, nodes only have to validate their respective shard(s). Individual shards shared their transaction details with the Beacon Chain, which acts as the backbone of Ethereum 2.0. The Beacon Chain serves to validate the transactions on each shard, helping the entire network reach consensus. It also identifies dishonest validators and initiates penalties in the form of slashing, in which a portion of a validator's stake is removed from circulation. Eth 2.0 will also replace the EVM with Ethereum WebAssembly (eWASM), which intends to translate coding logic more efficiently and help improve Ethereum’s scalability.","client_repositories":[{"name":"go-ethereum","link":"https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum","license_type":"LGPL 3.0"},{"name":"aleth","link":"https://github.com/ethereum/aleth","license_type":"GPL 3.0"},{"name":"trinity","link":"https://github.com/ethereum/trinity","license_type":"MIT"}]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"Gas Economics","date":null,"type":null,"details":"[https://github.com/LeastAuthority/ethereum-analyses/blob/master/GasEcon.md](https://github.com/LeastAuthority/ethereum-analyses/blob/master/GasEcon.md)"},{"title":"Analysis of Ethash, Ethereum's Proof-of-Work puzzle","date":null,"type":null,"details":"[https://github.com/LeastAuthority/ethereum-analyses/blob/master/PoW.md](https://github.com/LeastAuthority/ethereum-analyses/blob/master/PoW.md)"}],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[{"title":"The DAO Hack","date":"2016-06-01T04:00:00Z","type":"Hack","details":"An attacker exploited a bug in one of The DAO smart contracts, allowing the guilty party to steal 3.6 million ETH.

The attack reduced the rate of block production by 50-66% as block validation times ballooned to 20-60 seconds (as opposed to 12-14 seconds).\n\nIn response, Ethereum developers opted to initiate a hard fork at block 2463000 (Oct. 18, 2016) to implement EIP-150, which addressed the issue of underpriced operation codes to make future DDoS attacks cost-prohibitive. The Ethereum team initially proposed issuing a second hard fork upgrade to introduce EIP-158. But they later decided to replace it with EIP-161, which they included in the Spurious Dragon hard fork."}]}},"governance":{"governance_details":"Ethereum operates similarly to Bitcoin through off-chain, informal governance.

Despite the correlation between voting weight and tokens held, users do not submit tokens alongside their votes and are therefore not subject to any direct financial burden. Hence, the loosely coupled label given to this style of governance by Vitalik Buterin.\n\nEthereum does not have any examples of coin voting as a built-in layer-1 protocol feature (referred to as tightly couple coin voting).

Cardano does not have a single published white paper but is developed from a collection of academic papers.

Cardano is named after an Italian Renaissance mathematician, Gerolamo Cardano, and its native currency ADA is named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician sometimes referenced as the first computer programmer. \n\nCardano is backed by three entities: IOHK, The Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo. IOHK is a blockchain research and development company founded by Charles Hoskinson and Jeremy Wood that is contracted to work on Cardano from 2015 through 2020. The Cardano Foundation is a non-profit organization focused on core development and ecosystem growth for Cardano. Emurgo is a Japanese venture capital firm. \n\nCardano's full launch will consist of five phases: Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire. The Byron era arrived in Sep. 2017 with the mainnet launch of the Cardano blockchain. During this phase, the chain operated as a federated network that only supported ADA transactions. The next phase, Shelley, could launch towards the end of Jul. 2020, bringing Cardano's proposed Ouroboros Proas Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocol to life.

Sidechains are new blockchains (like shard chains) that interoperate with the main chain. They can help off-load work from this base layer to increase the overall capacity of the network (scalability through parallel computation). While Cardano uses a UTXO model, sidechains will also have the ability to support account-based models.

Ripple enables banks, payment providers, digital asset exchanges, and corporations to send money globally using blockchain technology. Leveraging the prior work of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/ryan-fugger\"\u003eRyan Fugger\u003c/a\u003e, in 2012 Ripple created the XRP Ledger (formerly known as Ripple Consensus Ledger), an open-source cryptographic ledger powered by a peer-to-peer network of nodes. XRP is the native asset of the XRP ledger.\n\nIn 2004, Ryan Fugger founded RipplePay, a financial technology company aiming to create a peer-to-peer payments network. Separately, in 2011, a team of Jed McCaleb began the development of a new consensus network for digital currencies that would ultimately become the XRP Ledger. Later Chris Larsen, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/david-schwartz\"\u003eDavid Schwartz\u003c/a\u003e, and Arthur Britto, would join the project, and in 2012 McCaleb and Larsen approached Ryan about RipplePay. After discussion with the RipplePay community Ryan handed over the project to McCaleb and Larsen, and in September 2012 they founded Opencoin (re-branded to Ripple Labs in 2013). \n\nIn 2013 Ripple released XRP, a native token on the Ripple Consensus Ledger. At launch, it created 100 billion XRP tokens of which 80 billion tokens were allocated to the company and 20 billion were given to the three founders. Over the course of 2013, Ripple would raise over $7.5 million from some of the most prestigious venture firms in the united states. Later that year Jed McCaleb would leave the company over internal disputes around the company's vision and would ultimately go on to found Stellar.\n\nAfter the initial release of the XRP Ledger, Ripple focused its efforts on getting financial institutions to use the ledger to process remittances. Entering the cross border payments market led to regulatory scrutiny, with FinCEN fining Ripple Inc for violating the bank secrecy act in 2015. As part of the remedial plan related to the fine, Ripple Inc agreed to enhance the anti-money laundering capabilities of the XRP protocol and stricter permissioning requirements were added for additional participants to join the network.\n\nTo further enhance the credibility of XRP as a partner for traditional financial institutions, Ripple obtained a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitlicense\"\u003eBitLicense\u003c/a\u003e from the State of New York in 2016. The upside of these enhancements and engagement with regulators was it gave XRP the capability to more deeply integrate with the traditional financial system. \n\nToday XRP's primary use is as a bridge currency underpinning \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/ripple\"\u003eRipple\u003c/a\u003e's xRapid product, an on-demand liquidity solution. xRapid allows financial institutions to exchange value between fiat currencies through a network a digital asset exchanges that use XRP as a bridge currency for its liquidity.\n\nTo date Ripple has raised over $120 million in venture funding, and XRP is one of the largest cryptocurrencies in the world by market capitalization. Ripple and its founding team own the substantial majority of the XRP supply of which Ripple the company programmatically sells on a quarterly basis. Since 2016 Ripple has sold over $1.1 billion worth of XRP and XRP sales remain Ripple's dominant source of revenue (and controversy).\n\n","issuing_organizations":[{"slug":"ripple","name":"Ripple","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D2159024400%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DXrVjNxkrjmIlt-NacD9nXlvo6uNkv_x_lfP5h0nmjv0","description":"Ripple Labs (a.k.a., \"Ripple\") is a digital asset technology company that develops the Ripple payment protocol.

XRP is burned to pay fees for transactions via Ripplenet. Nevertheless, XRP liquid and circulating supply are massively inflationary. \n\nIn December 2017, Ripple placed 55 billion XRP into escrow in order to alleviate concerns that a massive amount of XRP could hit the market all at once with substantial negative price impact. 1 billion is being released monthly to support Ripple’s ongoing operation of Ripplenet. Any unused funds are returned to escrow at the end of the month. On average Ripple re-escrows 700 million and 300 million XRP become liquid each month.\n\nRipple generated revenue from ongoing XRP sales, which account for well over 90% of the company's revenue. There are two types of XRP sales that the company discloses:\nProgrammatic sales: These come from the company’s XRP reserve, and can be sold at a rate of no more than 0.25% of average daily volume on defined exchanges. \nDirect sales from XRP II: These come from direct bespoke deals with institutional clients, and include (per Ripple’s 2016-2017 disclosures) reselling restrictions to ensure its partners do not purchase XRP at a discount from the company and then immediately flood the market with sales.\n\nRipple has sold over 1.2 billion USD worth of XRP through Direct Sales and Programmatic Sales. \n\nOur liquid supply curve takes into account the Ripple Escrow mechanism as well as the Founder' selling agreement to calculate liquid supply. As such, even though XRP's outstanding supply is deflationary over time through fee-burning, circulating and liquid supply are massively inflationary due to escrow release, founder's distributions, and Ripple sales.

This process occurs until a supermajority (80%) of UNL nodes have matching ledgers. Once a supermajority is reached, each server independently computes a new ledger hash from the agreed-upon set of transactions and compares results.

A supermajority of validators is required for the network to arrive at consensus to validate transactions initiated across the network.\n\nRipple Inc, has focused on integrating user verification protocols so network participants are able to define which users they trust and how much they trust them. This has the effect of causing transactions to “ripple” across the network. Because if two users without a direct relationship initiate a transaction across the network. It ripples outward finding a path linking the users together from their trusted relationships to complete the transaction. \n\nFor users just getting started, Ripple Inc. maintains a unique node list users can select by default representing validators with a history of reliably operating on the XRP network.\n\nCross-currency transactions typically take 3 – 5 seconds to process across the ledger. Once initiated, XRP’s pathfinding algorithm identifies the quickest least expensive way to complete the transaction. Generally, for the pathfinding algorithm to work optimally, a large number of market makers need to be operating on the network so sufficient liquidity is available to efficiently complete transactions.\n\nTo encourage the development of a robust ecosystem around the ledger, XRP maintains a variety of APIs to help nodes and other third parties interact with it based on the REST API standard.

Litecoin aimed to keep the best aspects of Bitcoin while making some optimizations for its use as a medium of exchange.\n\nNotably, Litecoin implements 2.5 minute block times and an 84 million max supply. Charlie Lee's original thinking was that quicker block confirmations would increase transaction throughput and reduce the amount of time merchants would need for block confirmations. Additionally, he thought the 84 million max supply would prevent the coin from becoming too scarce and expensive.

Off-chain, Chainlink consists of a network of oracle nodes that connect to public blockchains (initially just Ethereum). On-chain Chainlink consists of a series of smart contracts that provide an interface to requesting contracts demanding data feeds.\n\nChainlink's off-chain component consists of a network of oracle nodes connected to the Ethereum blockchain. These nodes independently harvest responses to off-chain requests.Their individual responses are aggregated via a smart contract on Ethereum, weighted, then returned to a requesting contract. ChainLink nodes are powered by the standard open source core implementation which handles standard blockchain interactions, scheduling, and connecting with common external resources.\n\nChainlink’s on-chain component consists of of three main contracts: a reputation contract, an order-matching contract, and an aggregating contract. The reputation contract keeps track of oracle-service-provider performance metrics. The order-matching smart contract takes and logs proposed service level agreements (SLAs), which include details such as query parameters (which data feeds to use), the number of oracles needed by the purchaser, collateral required, and uptime requirements, and collects bids from oracle providers. It then selects bids using the reputation contract and finalizes the oracle SLA. The aggregating contract collects the oracle providers’ responses and calculates the final collective result of the ChainLink query. It also feeds oracle provider metrics back into the reputation contract.\n\nThe way this flows begins with a user smart contract. User smart contracts broadcast request contracts containing SLAs defining parameters for the data request. Node operators who monitor the Ethereum blockchain for these request, then bid to service them using the order matching contract, which both collects bids and logs the SLA parameters. Users can also select specific node operators manually through either the Chainlink core team marketplace or third party marketplaces for matching requests. Once matched with a request node operators, node operators return external data to the aggregating contract, which aggregates data from operators into a single weighted value, sends performance metrics to the reputation contract, and then reports the single weighted value back to the smart contract that requested it. In exchange for their services, node operators are compensated in LINK.\n\nLINK is currently built on Ethereum, although it plans to integrate with all smart contract networks later on its roadmap.","client_repositories":[{"name":"Chainlink","link":"https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink","license_type":"MIT

However, discussions around the block limit largely stayed in the background until 2017 when tensions within the Bitcoin community rose over rising transaction fees and increasingly divergent opinions on scaling Bitcoin. Supporters of bigger blocks believed that for Bitcoin to fulfill the vision of a peer-to-peer electronic currency as outlined in the original whitepaper, it was crucial to raise the block limit in order to increase transaction capacity. Bitcoin Cash proponents pushed for a system that could scale to VISA level transaction throughput without second layers and while maintaining affordable transaction fees. It rejected the philosophy of Bitcoin Core that Bitcoin's central value proposition is censorship resistance and trust-minimization, and that Bitcoin full nodes needed to be maximally decentralized to achieve this. Instead of envisioning Bitcoin as a settlement layer or a Digital Gold, Bitcoin Cash envisions Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, emphasizing Bitcoin's utility as a medium of exchange.\n\nIn 2017 at the Consensus conference amidst rising transaction fees on Bitcoin and increasingly tense debate around the Bitcoin block limit, a meeting with miners and Core Developers took place in what is referred to as the “New York Agreement”, where an agreement was reached to support \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/segregated-witness\"\u003eSegWit\u003c/a\u003e and a 2MB \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hard-fork\"\u003ehard fork\u003c/a\u003e. Known as SegWit2x, this proposal was backed by over 80% of the network’s hash rate. Despite the desires of miners, users wanted to activate SegWit without the block size increase. They set a date (August 1, 2017) where Bitcoin would \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/soft-fork\"\u003esoft fork\u003c/a\u003e to support SegWit and keep the 1MB block size. Enough nodes signaled support for it that they forced miners to accept or have their blocks rejected by the network. A faction of the bigger blocks camp, rejected SegWit altogether, citing frustrations with the prioritization of SegWit over bigger blocks, and on August 1, 2017 they launched a hard fork of Bitcoin called Bitcoin Cash, with 8MB block limits. The 8MB block limit was later increased to 32MB in 2018 after another contentious hard fork regarding a minority faction's desire to raise the block limit to 128MB. This hard fork resulted in the creation of Bitcoin SV, a fork of Bitcoin Cash. \n\nAlthough increased block capacity could increase transaction throughput on-chain, it could potentially restrict the universe of participants who could be capable of running full \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/node\"\u003enodes\u003c/a\u003e, thus making this something the community needs to address in order to be able to execute on its vision of a decentralized peer-to-peer cash system. In addition to pursuing on-chain scalability through larger block sizes, Bitcoin Cash prioritizes fast-paced development of technological improvements in opposition to the more conservative philosophy of Bitcoin. Given such, Bitcoin Cash has planned network upgrades every six months. To date, Bitcoin Cash has 6 competing node implementations: BitcoinABC, Bitcoin Unlimited, BXT, Parity, Bitprim, and Bitcoin Cash.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Bitcoin Cash Hard Fork","date":"2017-08-01T04:00:00Z","type":"Mainnet","details":"Genesis of Bitcoin Cash"},{"title":"Planned Protocol Upgrade","date":"2018-05-15T04:00:00Z","type":"Mainnet","details":"Increased block limit to 32MB.

As such, it went through two halvings to date; in November 2012, and again in July 2016, each cutting the initial block reward by half. On average, Bitcoin Cash generates new blocks every 10 minutes, rewarding miners with 12.5 new BCH and the total transaction fees from the preceding block. Each block has a 32MB limit and block rewards are \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/halving\"\u003ehalved \u003c/a\u003eevery 210,000 blocks (approximately 4 years). Eventually, once the 21 million BCH hard cap has been reached, block rewards will transition entirely to transaction fees shifting the security model of the protocol to one based on demand for block space versus one based on demand for BCH. Bitcoin Cash's next halving is expected to happen in May 2020.\n\nThe difference between BCH and BTC supply curves since the fork can be explained by the difficulty adjustment algorithm which included one addition compared to Bitcoin: the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment (EDA). This mechanism was set by the Bitcoin Cash developers to incentivize miners to prioritize BCH’s transactions over that of BTC’s. Miners leveraged this mechanism to maximize their profit by reducing their BCH mining output while waiting for the Emergency Difficulty Adjustment to reduce BCH’s difﬁculty, which in turn would lead to higher returns. As a result, 120,000 more BCH than BTC were mined from August 01, 2017, until November 13, 2017, when Bitcoin Cash underwent a hard fork to change the difficulty adjustment algorithm. \n\n","general_emission_type":"Inflationary","precise_emission_type":"Decreasing Issuance","is_capped_supply":true,"max_supply":20999999.9769},"consensus":{"consensus_details":"Consensus\n\nBitcoin Cash uses \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/nakamoto-consensus\"\u003eNakamoto Consensus\u003c/a\u003e whereby the valid chain is the longest chain with the most accumulated \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\"\u003eproof-of-work\u003c/a\u003e.

Protocol development is governed by a proposal process whereby anyone in the open-source Bitcoin Cash community can submit draft proposals. After debate by the community, the client implementation editors accept or reject the proposals. Decisions from the process are written into the Bitcoin Cash specification, as well as the software that runs the network. Finally, protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus. \n\nAlthough very similar to Bitcoin overall, as opposed to users signaling support of upgrades, Bitcoin Cash tends to use hash power signaling to indicate support of network upgrades.

Some of Palmer's friends encouraged him to create a real Dogecoin project, so he registered dogecoin.com and started working. Billy Markus saw the website and reached out to Palmer. Markus and Palmer thought Dogecoin would make the cryptocurrency space more palletable to newcomers since, as they built the protocol, Bitcoin was beleaguered by associations with Silk Road and dark web. Palmer exited the Dogecoin project and community in June 2014 by tweeting, \"Unsubshibing. Peace.\"\n\nUnlike a variety of other altcoins launched in 2013 and 2014, Dogecoin has proved itself surprisingly resilient to crypto-asset market cycles, which is speculated to be the result of meme durability.

With the creation of the non-for profit \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/stellar-development-foundation\"\u003eStellar Development Foundation\u003c/a\u003e (SDF), the team aimed to \"promote global financial access, literacy, and inclusion...and create an open and affordable financial system where people of all income levels can access simple-to-use, secure, and low cost financial services.\" The Stellar Development Foundation was created in collaboration with Stripe CEO Patrick Collison. Stripe invested $3 million in seed funding and received 2 billion Stellar Lumens (XLM) in exchange. At launch the network generated 100 billion XLM and featured a 1% annual issuance rate. \n\nIn 2015, Stellar redesigned its consensus protocol following a ledger fork in 2014 that rolled back hours of transactions. It's new and current consensus protocol called \"Stellar Consensus Protocol\" was developed by Stanford professor \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/david-mazi-res\"\u003eDavid Mazières\u003c/a\u003e, chief scientist of the SDF.

In 2017, Stellar announced a grants program that would award partners up to $2 million worth of Lumens for project development.\n\nIn October 2019 Stellar removed the 1% annual issuance rate from the Stellar protocol stating that it was not benefiting the projects building on Stellar.\n\nIn November 2019, the Stellar Development Foundation \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/stellar-development-foundation-burns-more-than-half-of-lumen-supply-with-new-strategy-focus\"\u003eannounced\u003c/a\u003e it burned more than 55 billion XLM (~55%) tokens as it moves away from airdrop programs.

Citing a declining utility from airdrops, the SDF burned 50 billion of those tokens along with 5 billion of the 17 billion previously held in its operating fund. The burn reduced the total supply to 50 billion XLM of which SDF's ownership of the total dropped from XLM supply from 85% to 60%.\n","issuing_organizations":[{"slug":"stellar-development-foundation","name":"Stellar Development Foundation ","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/1%2A0ZyISskMlUEN8KyelN1-ZA.png","description":"Stellar Development Foundation is a nonprofit organization taht designs and develops an online financial platform.

The goal of the Direct Sign-up Program was \"to make lumens easily accessible to millions of individuals and communities across the globe\" through airdrops.\n20% would be allocated to the Bitcoin Program.

Nevertheless, those distribution mechanisms initially designed by the SDF proved hard to effectively execute:\nOut of the 20 billion XLM to be distributed to Bitcoin holders (19 billion) and XRP holders (1 billion), only 2.037 billion were distributed in two rounds, in October 2016 and August 2017. The rest (17.963 billion) was re-allocated to the SDF operational budget in 2017. As such, the SDF increased its operational budget, initially set at 3 billion XLM by 600% through this re-allocation. \nOut of the 50 billion XLM to be distributed through the Direct Sign-up program, the SDF only managed to effectively distribute 4.2 billion XLM, less than 10% of what was originally planned. \nOut of the 25 billion XLM to be distributed through the Partnership program, the SDF only managed to effectively distribute 1.138 billion XLM, less than 5% of what was originally planned. It's also interesting to note that the address that received this 1.138 billion XLM sent then back to the SDF-managed address in November 2019, right before the SDF burnt 55 billion XLM, as detailed below. \n\nGlobally, the SDF only managed to distribute 7.375 billion XLM through these three programs, instead of the 95 billion initially scheduled. \n\nBuilt-in Inflation Mechanism\n\nUntil October 2019, the Stellar ledger also featured a built-in, fixed, nominal inflation mechanism. New Lumens were added to the network at a rate of 1% each year. Each week, the protocol would distribute these Lumens to any account that receives over 0.05% of the “votes” from other accounts in the network.  Given the very high supply concentration within the SDF treasury addresses due to the inefficiency of the distribution mechanisms, the SDF would receive over 95% of the votes, and thus 95% of the built-in inflation, increasing its operational budget by more than 4 billion XLM thanks to this built-in inflation mechanism. In October 2019 Stellar removed the 1% annual issuance rate from the Stellar protocol stating that it was not benefiting the projects building on Stellar.\n\n2017 Inflation Exploit\n\nFrom January to April 2017, Stellar suffered a serious inflation bug, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/c/research/stellar-s-2017-inflation-exploit\"\u003ediscovered in 2019 by Messari\u003c/a\u003e. The bug was exploited, significantly inflationary, and patched with little publicity in April 2017. The attacker was able to create over 2.2 billion Lumens worth nearly $10 million at the time. Once it discovered and patched the bug, the SDF destroyed the equivalent number of coins that were created through the bug. Nevertheless, the XLM burned to offset the inflation bug came from the Direct Sing-up program allocation. As such, the SDF burnt supply that was meant to be distributed to the crowd to offset an inflation bug that was exploited by an attacker.\n\nOverhang burning\n\nConscious of the difficulty the distribute this important supply overhang, the SDF decided to burn more than 55 billion XLM in November 2019.\n37.6 billion XLM were burned from the Direct Sign-up Program allocation, reducing the supply left to be distributed to 4 billion XLM. As a result, instead of distributing 50 billion XLM through the Direct Sign-up program, the SDF will only distribute a maximum of 8.2 billion XLM (4.2 billion distributed from 2015 to 2019 and 4 billion left to be distributed). \n12.988 billion XLM were burned from the Partnership program, reducing the supply left to be distributed to 8 billion XLM. As a result, instead of distribution 25 billion XLM through the Partnership program, the SDF will only distribute a maximum of 8 billion XLM. \n4.88 billion XLM were burned from the SDF operational budget. Nevertheless, this burn only offset the newly issued XLM received through the built-in inflation during the first 5 years of the protocol. \n\nThrough this burn, the SDF reduced the maximum supply from 105 billion XLM to 50 billion XLM.

In an FBA system, there are quorums and quorum slices. Quorum is a set of nodes sufficient to reach agreement. Given that an FBA system is open participation, meaning that participants can join and leave as they please, it is impossible for the system to know how many nodes are sufficient for quorum without knowing the identities and amounts of nodes in the system. Thus, FBA introduces a concept of quorum slices nodes. A quorum slice is a subset of a quorum that can convince one particular node about agreement. In an FBA system nodes broadcast and individually determine which quorums slices to trust, and build their own quorum based on the information they have at hand. In FBA systems it is crucial that these quoroms overlap to ensure the network reaches consensus. Ripple for example, provides a list of trusted validators to use in order ensure there is overlap when participating in the Ripple Consensus Protocol (RCP). \n\nConsensus in FBA systems is reached through a multi round process where validators share ledger candidates between each other, adding and subtracting transactions until their candidate proposals match what their validators in their quorom slice proposed. Once a supermajority is reached, each server independently computes a new ledger hash from the agreed-upon set of transactions and compares results. Once a super majority of validators agree upon the hash of the new ledger candidate, the ledger candidate is considered final.\n\nSCP differentiates itself from RCP in that validators can choose their own quorom slices rather than using a pre-defined one (from Ripple). Furthermore, rather than relying on a super majority of nodes for consensus SCP introduces notions of validator quality, where validators are weighted based on trustworthiness and reliability, and validator grouping, where validators are grouped by organization. SCP posit these additions allow for stronger quorums.\n","general_consensus_mechanism":"Other","precise_consensus_mechanism":"Stellar Consensus Protocol","targeted_block_time":4,"block_reward":null,"mining_algorithm":null,"next_halving_date":null,"is_victim_of_51_percent_attack":false}},"native_treasury":{"accounts":[],"treasury_usage_details":null}},"technology":{"overview":{"technology_details":"The Stellar blockchain consensus mechanism is called Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), an implementation of the Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA). The FBA is a fairly new consensus mechanism pioneered by Ripple. The SCP is the first provable safe FBA blockchain protocol.\n\nAn FBA allows nodes to choose which peers the trust based on intrinsic or extrinsic factors set by the nodes. This dynamic creates network-wide quorums as individual nodes relay and verify network activity information. FBAs rely on “quorum slices” to reach consensus—subsets of a quorum that can convince an individual node to agree with the “slice.” Stellar nodes can choose their own quorum slices.\n\nTo attack the Stellar network, a reputable institution would need to control 51% or more of the network’s trusted nodes. Stellar disinventivizes this by financial rewarding honest actors in the network via fees and other rewards. Stellar also adds an element of reputation and social identity by keeping network actors as known entities, which incentivizes financial institutions to maintain the trust of their peers.\n\nSome of these trusted financial institutions are called Anchors, a crucial part of the Stellar blockchain network. Anchors maintain wallets with fiat and XLM balances to allow currency exchange. Anchors control the fees they charge for network peers to use their services, and users can pick which anchor manages their exchanges.\n\nThe Stellar blockchain also supports launching native assets similar to issuing tokens on Ethereum. Compared to Ethereum, Stellar aims to offer faster transactions and lower network fees. All assets on the Stellar blockchain are not traded only by exchanging credits across between accounts in the network that are managed by anchors.

Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs) deal with changes to the standards, protocols, and methods used in the ecosystem built on top of the Stellar network.

Lenders provide liquidity by depositing cryptocurrencies in a pool contract. Simultaneously, in the same contract, the pooled funds can be borrowed by placing collateral. Loans do not need to be individually matched, instead, they rely on the pooled funds, as well as the amounts borrowed and their collateral. This enables instant loans with characteristics based on the state of the pool.\n\nFlash Loans\nAave also allows loans to be taken out without any collateral by creating logic that if it's not repaid within the block time, the transaction gets reversed. These flash loans are designed to be used by developers to build tools that require capital for arbitrage, refinancing or liquidating purposes. An example would be if a user took out a loan on \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/maker\"\u003eMaker\u003c/a\u003e and the collateral price dropped making it close to liquidation, they could use a flash loan to repay the Maker loan and receive their collateral back. They could then sell the collateral to repay the flash loan thus avoiding the liquidation penalty on Maker without ever needing to actually have the funds necessary for repayment.\n\nRate Switching\nAnother unique feature of Aave is that it allows borrowers to switch between fixed and floating interest rates. Interest rates in DeFi are traditionally volatile making it difficult to estimate the long-term cost of borrowing. If a user anticipates interest rates to rise they can switch their loan to fixed rate in order to lock in their borrowing costs for the future, and if they expect rates to decrease they can switch back to floating to then decrease their borrowing costs. There are two exceptions where the fixed rate can actually change and that is if the deposit earning rate increases above the fixed borrow rate because the system could get unstable by paying out more than its being paid. In that case, the fixed rate is rebalanced to the new stable rate. the other scenario which works in the borrower's favor is if the variable rate is lower than the fixed rate by 20%, the loan will automatically decrease to account for the difference. \n","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"Security Audit","date":null,"type":null,"details":"Audited by Trail of Bits and

Bytecoin launched in March 2014; however, after a controversial 80% premine, a Bitcointalk forum user known as thankfulfortoday forked the codebase of Bytecoin into the a new project named BitMonero, a compound of Bit (as in Bitcoin) and Monero (meaning \"coin\" in Esperanto). \n\nThe release of BitMonero was poorly received by the community that initially backed it, leading seven community members to fork BitMonero into a new project called Monero. This largely pseudonymous group, led by Fluffypony (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/riccardo-spagni\"\u003eRiccardo Spagni\u003c/a\u003e), ultimately became the first Monero Core team. Monero launched its project in April 2014 with no premine. \n\nMonero's payment anonymity has garnered significant attention from a panoply of crypto-curious persons. Since its launch Monero has become one of the most widely used darknet currencies in the world due to its anonymity by default features. In 2017 Monero further enhanced its privacy features by incorporating Ring CT signatures, a solution proposed by Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell, that obscures transaction amounts for each entry in the ring signature, in addition to obscuring the transaction address. This provided near complete transaction anonymity in contrast to just sender anonymity as it was previously. In October 2018, Monero implemented bulletproofs, a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/zero-knowledge-proofs\"\u003ezero-knowledge proof\u003c/a\u003e technology that replaced the previous zero-knowledge range proofs that its confidential transactions relied on. Bulletproofs cut the size of its confidential transactions by at least 80 percent, significantly increasing transaction efficiency. \n\nMonero undergoes scheduled hard forks every six months intended to allow Monero to evolve at a regular cadence, while still leaving users enough time to update before being forked away from the network. These hard forks tend to include everything from patches and bug fixes to hashing algorithm changes and functionality upgrades.\n\nIn December 2019, Fluffypony (Riccardo Spagni), Monero's lead maintainer \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/monero-s-fluffypony-steps-down\"\u003estepped down\u003c/a\u003e from the project in an effort to further decentralize the project.

Consensus in Monero, and other systems using Nakamoto Conensus, is probabilistic because there is always a chance that a new, longer competing chain could emerge with more accumulated proof-of-work, that would invalidate the current chain.\n\nMining\nMiners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using the RandomX proof-of-work algorithm. In this process, miners compete to generate a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/blog/hash-function\"\u003ehash\u003c/a\u003e less than the target number set by Monero's \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level\"\u003edifficulty adjustment algorithm\u003c/a\u003e. The target difficulty level is adjusted every block.\n\nIn the pursuit of decentralization at the miner level, Monero periodically changes its proof-of-work algorithm via hard forks to ensure Monero remains ASIC resistant and open to individuals with commodity hardware. Like many proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, mining is now done in pools where participants contribute \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hash-power\"\u003ehash power\u003c/a\u003e to the pool and receive a proportional share of the profits if the pool finds a valid block. This is to smooth individuals' mining revenue as mining has become more competitive. \n\nBlock sizes in Monero are dynamic and there is no preset block size limit like there is in Bitcoin. However, despite there being no block size limits, Monero has a block reward penalty system that keeps block sizes in check. The block reward penalty system works first by taking the median size of the last 100 blocks. If a new block's size is greater than that median, then the block reward gets reduced quadratically depending on how much the new block size exceeds that median. The maximum block size is set at two times the median of the last 100 blocks, and as the block size approaches that limit the block reward approaches zero.

A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/mempool\"\u003emempool\u003c/a\u003e) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Monero's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Monero uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. \n\nMonero runs a proof-of-work algorithm called RandomX, an algorithm using random code execution and memory-hard techniques for ASIC resistance. Monero initiates hard forks every 6 months to implement upgrades to the protocol, often times changing its PoW algorithm to prevent ASICs from joining the network.\n\nMonero's privacy enhancements stem from ring signatures, which mask sender identities and offers single-use keys to make transactions untraceable. Ring signatures merge a group of signers together to better preserve the anonymity of the true signer. The group is comprised of the actual signers single use key initiating the transaction and past transaction outputs from Monero’s blockchain. Including past transaction outputs helps preserve the senders anonymity because they are theoretically indistinguishable to an outside observer as the valid transaction itself. \n\nIn January 2017, Monero implemented Ring Confidential Transactions (Ring CTs) in an effort to combat concerns around the true degree of anonymity offered by Monero. Ring signatures only provided privacy for the sender of the transaction, and required outputs to be broken up into separate rings because ring signatures could only contain outputs of the same value. Ring CT signatures aimed to alleviate these concerns by obscuring transaction amounts for each entry in the ring signature, in addition to obscuring the transaction address. With Ring CTs wallets could arbitrarily select ring members from any output size. To prove that certain amounts were spent, Ring CTs used range proofs, a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/zero-knowledge-proofs\"\u003ezero knowledge cryptography\u003c/a\u003e technique used to prove the amount used in a transaction with revealing the details. \n\nHowever, the range proofs used in Monero's confidential transactions to ensure the integrity of transactions, were computationally intensive, leading the Monero blockchain to bloat due to the onerous data requirements of each transaction. Thus, in October 2018 Monero implemented bulletproofs, which addressed this scalability issue, cutting the size of its confidential transactions by at least 80 percent and significantly increasing transaction efficiency. Bulletproofs are a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof that does not require a trusted setup. Bulletproofs aggregate information into new data structures that scale logarithmically, rather than linearly, allowing even greater scaling for larger transactions that contain multiple outputs.","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":"Monero protocol development involves a proposal process whereby anyone in the open source Monero community can submit proposals for improving the Monero protocol. After debate by the community, when consensus has emerged, the Monero Core maintainers merge code changes into Monero Core's GitHub Repository. Once new code has been implemented into the Monero Core client, users of the network (full nodes) must be persuaded to adopt the new changes. Protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus.\n\nMonero funds protocol development through its Forum Funding System (FFS), a donation based crowdfunding system. The FFS is a system whereby anyone can propose ideas and request anonymous donations to fund development work. Once proposals have been funded, funds are released as certain milestones are reached.    \n\nMonero opts for scheduled hard forks every six months. The community believes that not only does this ensure the protocol is continuously being improved at a regular cadence, but it also keeps the community engaged in the governance process.

The project aimed to develop a new efficient micro processor for IoT devices based on trinary (rather than binary) calculation methods. In order to finance R\u0026D of the hardware project, the Jinn team held a crowd sale for in September 2014, selling ~100,000 JINN tokens (10% of the total) for 8,5000,000 \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/nxt\"\u003eNXT\u003c/a\u003e worth $250,000 at the time. The JINN tokens were launched on the NXT platform and represented a share in the profits of the Jinn company. \n\nHowever, fearing regulatory issues surrounding their JINN, which represented a claim on the Jinn's profits, the Jinn team pivoted. On a BitcoinTalk forum in 2015, the Jinn founders announced a new project called IOTA. IOTA aimed to be \"a brand new and novel micro-transaction cryptotoken optimized for the Internet-of-Things (IoT).\" According to Jinn founder Sønstebø, \"...it only makes sense first to introduce IOTA and then Jinn afterwards.\" \n\nIOTA Crowdsale\nThe team similarly did a crowdsale for their IOTA token, which instead of being a profit sharing token like JINN, was a utility token used for payment on the IOTA network. IOTA sold 999,999,999 tokens in its 2015 crowdsale raising a total of 1,337 Bitcoin, equivalent to $434,000 at the time. Jinn token holders were also allowed to participate in the IOTA crowdsale by converting their JINN tokens for IOTA at a fixed exchange rate of 0.0063BTC per JINN. The supply was later changed to 2.78 billion IOTA. According to IOTA documentation the token supply was increased because “high supply makes IOTA optimal for tiny nano transactions while still keeping efficiency in mind.“ 5% of the funds from the IOTA's token offering were later donated to the IOTA Foundation, which was formally announced in October 2017.\n\nMainnet Launch\nIn July 2016, IOTA launched on Mainet. The project aimed to provide distributed ledger technology for the internet-of-things (IoT) space where small connected devices regularly share data. Because these devices are generally specialized to be low power and application specific IOTA does not use a traditional consensus mechanism like proof-of-work or proof-of-stake nor does it use a blockchain structure. The goal of the project is to allow these devices to conduct micropayment transactions between themselves and potentially to securely transfer data. \n\nAt the core of the project is what is referred to as the 'Tangle,' a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that acts as the public ledger system.

The efficiency of this system also grows as the number of participants increases as transactions will be processed at a faster rate.

In the Tangle there are no blocks or miners, and every transaction on the Iota network must validate two previous transactions through a small proof-of-work (PoW). Therefore, users who issue a transactions are contributing to the network's security. Transaction on IOTA are stored in the tangle graph, which is the ledger for storing transactions.  \n\nThe main idea of the tangle is the following: to issue a transaction, users must work to approve other transactions. Once transactions are confirmed, they are broadcast to the entire network, where another unconfirmed transaction can decided to approve the newly confirmed transaction. It is assumed that the nodes check if the approved transactions are not conflicting. If a node \u000cadds that a transaction is in conflict with the tangle history, the node will not approve the conflicting transaction in either a direct or indirect manner. As transactions receive additional approvals, they are accepted by the system with a higher level of confidence.  \n\nApprovals add \"weight\" to a transaction. The weight of a transaction is proportional to the amount of work that the issuing node invested into it. it. Transactions with larger weights are more important than transactions with a smaller weight. Transactions accumulate weight over time. A transaction's cumulative weight is the weight of the transaction plus the sum of weights of all transactions that directly or indirectly approve this transaction. The time is takes for transactions to get approved is inversely proportional to the amount transactions being issued on the network. Once transactions are approved their weight will grow at the rate of the incoming flow of transactions. \n\nAlthough not mentioned in the whitepaper, the IOTA network currently relies on a coordinator node that provides trusted milestone transactions, and snapshots which are used to reduce the size of the network.

Occurring roughly every month, snapshots aim to reduce the size of the IOTA network, preventing it from bloating. Full Nodes in IOTA only store the history up to the latest Snapshot.\n\nIOTA plans to remove the coordinator once the network reaches scale. Furthermore, it eventually plans to incentivize full nodes to store the entire Tangle history beyond snapshots issued by the IOTA foundation.  \n","client_repositories":[{"name":"Iota","link":"https://github.com/iotaledger","license_type":"MIT License"}]},"security":{"audits":[],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[{"title":"Curl Hash Function Vulnerability","date":"2017-09-07T04:00:00Z","type":"Cryptographic Hashing Algorithm","details":"https://github.com/mit-dci/tangled-curl/blob/master/vuln-iota.md"}]}},"governance":{"governance_details":"The IOTA Foundation is primarily responsible for funding and leading development of IOTA.

The project competes with other popular smart contract platforms such as Ethereum (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\"\u003e$ETH\u003c/a\u003e), NEO (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/neo\"\u003e$NEO\u003c/a\u003e), and Cardano (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/cardano\"\u003e$ADA\u003c/a\u003e). EOS tries to differentiate itself by providing transaction throughput capable of handling thousands of transactions per second without having to pay direct fees, improved usability for all parties involved, and governance for business and chain maintenance.\n\nEOS makes use of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/on-chain-governance\"\u003eon-chain governance\u003c/a\u003e whereby token holders can vote for the block producers (BPs) as well as various upgrades to the protocol, monetary policy, or stakeholder bylaws. The EOS User Agreement defines and enforces the user bylaws. The rules are not enforceable at the protocol level but rather act as a terms-of-service agreement that users must agree to. This community developed agreement replaced Block.one's Constitution by a majority BP vote back in April 2019.\n\nEcosystem funds play an important role in the growth and adoption of EOS. Their mandate is to make strategic investments that increase the value of the projects and tokens to ensure the necessary infrastructure is built and proper incentivization exists to attract developers to build on the platform.

While BPs must share a smaller piece of the total reward pool, there are only 21 BPs; thus, they receive more daily EOS rewards on average than their counterparts. Standby Producers represent potential block producers ranked outside of the top 21 that have enough voting support from token holders to receive a minimum daily reward of 100 EOS.\n\nHistoric supply and inflation changes\nAt launch, the inflation rate for EOS was 5%, but this metric was somewhat misleading as the network routed 4% of newly minted tokens into the eosio.saving account. The supply directed to this account was illiquid and only accessible by way of a successful vote among the network's 21 block producers (BPs). The rest of the outstanding inflation went to BPs and Standby Producers per the same percentage breakdown described above.\n\nBPs can also vote on decreasing or increasing the inflation rate. Therefore, these network representatives can impact the future supply of EOS by altering the block reward or changing the contents of the eosio.saving account, an act that has happened twice since inception.\n\nOn May 8, 2019, BPs opted to burn all of the tokens collected in the eosio.saving account up until that point, which amounted to 34 million EOS. The inflation rate remained intact, however, so that account continued to accrue 80% of the newly issued (but still illiquid) EOS supply.\n\nIn Feb. 2020, fifteen of the twenty-one BPs voted again to burn the over 34 million EOS tokens (worth almost $140 million at the time) held in the eosio.saving account. This vote also reduced the inflation rate of the network from 5% to its current rate of 1%. This inflation reduction only eliminated the 80% of block rewards previously dedicated to the eosio.saving account, effectively eliminating the role of that account on the network. Since the contents of the eosio.saving account were already illiquid, the vote's impact on the circulating supply and real inflation rate was minimal.\n\nBlock.one vesting schedule\nBlock.one allocated itself 100 million EOS tokens at launch to fund future ecosystem development. These tokens will unlock linearly every second over a period of ten years starting from the network's Genesis Block on Jun. 6, 2018. In May 2019, Block.one claimed a vested batch of 9.8 million EOS and used 3.3 million of these tokens (worth ~$25 million at the time) to purchase network RAM. The firm now only holds the current and future rights to 96.7 million EOS tokens.\n\nImpact of the eosio.ramfee account\nUntil May 1, 2019, and the launch of Resource Exchange (REX) on EOS Mainnet, the fees collected from RAM trading (0.5% of the value of each trade) were sent and stored on the eosio.ramfee account.  From May 1, 2019, the fees are now directly transferred from the eosio.ramfee to the REX, but the funds (approximately 2M EOS) that were located in the eosio.ramfee account before the upgrade will not be allocated to the REX and remain illiquid. \n\nBlacklisted accounts\nEOSIO also has a feature that allows Block Producers to blacklist accounts. All the Block Producers need to blacklist an account in order for the blacklist to happen. Those blacklisted accounts' supply is considered illiquid since it is no longer transferable.

Beyond its delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, EOS employs Graphene technology and (in the long-term) parallel processing to maximize performance.\nGraphene technology: An open-course software toolkit developed by Dan Larimer that helps improve transaction processing capabilities. It is currently used by previous Larimer creations, Bitshares and Steem, as well as MUSE and Peerplay.\nParallel computation: Also referred to as horizontal scaling, this technology divides transactions and smart contract execution among multiple processors to help reduce the run time of a program. The first protocol version will operate on a single thread (i.e., a single processor) but will shift to a multithreaded platform in the future.\n\nEOS requires users to obtain the following resources to submit transactions and run decentralized applications:\nCPU: the processing power it takes to operate a dApp and read data from a storage device (measured in microseconds)\nNET: network bandwidth or the average rate of data transfer through the communication protocol (measured in bytes)\nRAM: data storage\n\nEOS holders receive CPU and NET by staking their tokens and receiving a proportional amount of the network resources. As a result, the network utilizes a no direct fee model where tokens give holders access to their pro-rata share of network resources. That being said, any operation needing storage or to create an account requires RAM to be purchased separately.\n\nEOS uses the WebAssembly Virtual Machine (WASM), which offers high speed and performance as well as support for a multitude of programming languages such as C, C++, and Rust, giving developers access to existing optimization and debugging tools.\n\nAdditionally, EOS implements human-readable names and account recovery solutions at the protocol level. Recovery is made possible with the designation of a recovery party that can reset the owner's keys with their approval. Unlike traditional multi-signature applications, the recovery partner has no control over the account other than helping the owner reset their keys.","client_repositories":[{"name":"eos","link":"https://github.com/EOSIO/eos","license_type":"MIT"}]},"security":{"audits":[],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[{"title":"Block Producer collusion uncovered","date":"2018-10-02T04:00:00Z","type":"Governance","details":"A Huobi employee allegedly a href=\"https://messari.io/article/rampant-collusion-in-eos-exposed-by-huobi-leak\"leaked/a a spreadsheet detailing unethical collusion among block producers (BPs).

In 2018, the project purchased file sharing service BitTorrent in order to expand its product. Tron is a long-term project with a set of 6 phases. \n\nExodus: building the free platform for peer to peer distribution, storage, and content. Exodus’ goal is to provide a simple distributed file sharing built on something similar to IPFS. \nOdyssey: introducing financial incentives to encourage content creation. Odyssey is supposed to incentivize early adopters and foster the growth of a community consisting of content creators and consumers. Reimbursement for creation will be through a tipping scheme, instead of views and clicks - as those methods can be easily exploited through bots.\nGreat Voyage: launching TRON-native ICO capability. Tron looks to allow content creators to offer a stake in a potential personal brand through individual ICOs or branded tokens. \nApollo: enable content producers to issue personal tokens\nStar Trek: brings a decentralized gaming and forecasting platform.\nEternity: aim for further decentralization of the gaming industry. This phase aims to bring the ability to fund-raise and monetize based on community growth. \n\nEventually, Tron’s core technology will be based on the adaptation of IPFS and Ethereum’s platform. In short, what Tron is trying to create is a huge mixture of what is already being done by other projects. Relatedly, Tron is criticized for plagiarism regarding its white paper. Founder Justin Sun tweeted that the translation was done by volunteers and excused it as carelessness on the part of translators.\n","issuing_organizations":[{"slug":"tron-foundation","name":"TRON Foundation","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/1958.png","description":"The TRON foundation supports the development of the TRON network.

Super representatives are chosen through a voting system that allows users to vote based on the tokens that they hold.\n\nTron’s chain has a 3-tiered architecture: the storage layer, core layer, and application layer. The storage layer adopts a distributed protocol branched into block storage and state storage. Its underlying storage layer uses the graph database to manage data storage, which aims to manage data storage as Tron not only stores the node data but also inter-node connections. Its middle layer is composed of modules of smart contracts, account management, consensus and more. \n\nTronix (TRX) is the official name for the native Tron token. Miners earn TRX by providing data storage space to network users. Tron intends to be used as market model rather than a cloud model. Tron expects TRX tokens to act as a mediator between consumers and content creators without the need for token exchanges. It was initially an ERC20 token. On June 24th, 2018, Tron migrated from Ethereum protocol to TRON MainNet in a one-to-one swap.

He later released a white paper in Sept. 2014 that detailed more specifics about the project. Breitman published both articles under the pseudonym \"L. M Goodman\" akin to Bitcoin's anonymous founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. In the documents, the author stressed Bitcoin's design failed to account for a more inclusive governance process and did not facilitate the creation of new tokens. Breitman and his wife \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/person/kathleen-breitman\"\u003eKathleen\u003c/a\u003e, therefore, designed Tezos as a token issuance and smart contract platform with an \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/on-chain-governance\"\u003eon-chain governance\u003c/a\u003e model, which would allow XTZ holders to vote on proposed protocol upgrades to avoid forking the network.\n\nIn 2015, the Breitmans established a company called Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS), which was responsible for writing the initial code for Tezos. At its core, Tezos is a system designed to formalize proposing, voting for, and implementing changes to the functionality of the network. Once a proposal is submitted, holders of Tezos (XTZ) tokens can vote with a weighting of one vote per token. DLS released the source code in 2016 and used the codebase to launch an alphanet of the Tezos protocol in Feb. 2017, a few months before the Tezos token sale.\n\nTezos initial coin offering (ICO) and Foundation troubles\nThe Tezos \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/initial-coin-offering-ico\"\u003einitial coin offering (ICO)\u003c/a\u003e launched on July 1, 2017, and the two-week sale managed to raise ~$232 million in Bitcoin (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\"\u003e$BTC\u003c/a\u003e) and Ethereum (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\"\u003e$ETH\u003c/a\u003e), exceeding the project's target of $20 million. It was the largest ICO at the time, surpassed by Filecoin's (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/filecoin\"\u003e$FIL\u003c/a\u003e) ~$257 million token sale a few months later. The newly established Tezos Foundation, led by appointed president Johann Gevers, assumed control of the funds as well as the responsibility to deliver the sold tezzies to ICO contributors. The foundation, which did not include the Breitmans as board members for legal reasons, intended to use a portion of the funds to purchase Dynamic Ledger Solutions (DLS) from the Breitmans, a move that would transfer control of the Tezos codebase to the foundation.\n\nBefore the sale of DLS could take place, an internal dispute arose between the Breitmans and Gevers, leading to a delay in the distribution of XTZ tokens to investors. In response, angry investors launched several class-action lawsuits targeting Tezos and DLT, adding further delays to the protocol's development and token issuance event. The internal dispute ran its course by mid-Feb. 2018, when Gevers and another involved foundation member left their positions.\n\nMainnet launch\nThe foundation's early troubles caused the development team to miss its initial 2017 launch date. After the resolution, protocol development resumed, enabling the Tezos Foundation to release a betanet in June 2018. Once it completed a testing period on the betanet, the foundation launched the Tezos mainnet in Sept. 2018.\n\nThe launch introduced a new version of a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-stake\"\u003eProof-of-Stake (DPoS)\u003c/a\u003e consensus model. Token holders can participate in consensus by locking up their tokens in exchange for the ability to validate blocks. The industry commonly refers to this process as \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/staking'\"\u003estaking\u003c/a\u003e, but the Tezos community uses the synonymous term \"baking.\" The Tezos design expands on traditional PoS systems by enabling users to \"delegate\" tokens to bakers without transferring ownership. In this self-described \"liquid\" PoS model, a baker receives a block reward in the form of new XTZ tokens with a proportional amount of this reward distributed to users that delegated tokens to the baker. This system enables smaller token holders to participate in the validation (and reward) process if they hold less than the required amount to become a full baker.","issuing_organizations":[{"slug":"tezos-foundation","name":"Tezos Foundation","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/Tezos%20Foundation.png","description":"The Tezos Foundation helps guide the future direction and overall strategy of the Tezos protocol by managing the project's treasury and issuing grants to projects building on Tezos.

Because of the variable endorsement rewards structure, as well as the effective block generation time, the inflation can actually be lower than the maximum 5.51%.\n\nXTZ are burned in two cases:\nWhen a baker is caught acting maliciously (double baking or double endorsement) \nWhen a KT1 account, which is the smart contract for delegation, is created)","general_emission_type":"Inflationary","precise_emission_type":"Fixed Issuance","is_capped_supply":false,"max_supply":null},"consensus":{"consensus_details":"Liquid Proof-of-Stake overview\nIn Tezos, a participant needs to have a minimum stake of 8,000 XTZ to be considered a baker.

Bakers and endorsers receive rewards (in the form of XTZ inflation or newly minted tokens) for their contributions to incentivize consensus participation. The delegation process transcends traditional PoS models as anyone is free to participate as well as select and govern the validator of their choice to offload any infrastructure management or costs.\n\nImplicit vs. originated accounts\nOriginated accounts are contracts that can delegate funds to other accounts to participate in the baking process.

NeoVM is a lightweight, general-purpose virtual machine that is intended to support small programs (e.g. smart contracts) or can be ported into non-blockchain systems. \n\nNEO's goals of cross-chain interchangeability features come from NeoX, a protocol that supports cross-chain asset exchange and distributed transactions, which is to say it aims for consistency and executability of transactions across multiple protocols. \n\nFor its consensus mechanism, NEO relies on delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance (dBFT), which can support up to 10,000 transactions per second. Validating nodes are randomly selected to confirm on-chain transactions by a collective of book-keeping nodes, which mimics the consensus mechanism of protocols like Stellar in some ways. Chain hard forks are more more complicated under dBFT consensus than Proof of Work (PoW), for example. Users cannot fork the chain at will like under PoW consensus since dBFT requires a two-thirds user majority to operate. \n\nNEO also supports two native tokens: NEO and NeoGas (GAS). NEO is a payments token that also confers governance rights over the network's changes and development. GAS is a fuel token for the NEO virtual machine useful for executing smart contracts and supporting applications built on NEO.

They believed competing virtual currencies were not as viable for use in ordinary purchases, such as buying a cup of coffee, because transactions can take too long to confirm. In pursuit of this goal Dash created a two-tier network with incentivized nodes and decentralized project governance (Masternodes), instantly settled payments (InstantSend), instantly immutable blockchain (ChainLocks), and optional privacy (PrivateSend).\n\nThe Dash Network is governed by masternodes, powerful servers backed by collateral held in Dash designed to provide advanced services securely and governance over Dash's proposal system. In exchange for part of the block reward, masternodes provide a second layer of services to the network. They facilitate advanced functions such as InstantSend, PrivateSend, and ChainLocks, which protects Dash against 51% mining attacks. \n\nDash governance system, or treasury, distributes 10% of the block rewards for development of the project in a competitive and decentralized way.

They believed competing virtual currencies were not as viable for use in ordinary purchases, such as buying a cup of coffee, because transactions can take too long to confirm. Dash provides holders with a feature called InstantSend, which allows holders to send Dash on the Network and receive confirmation of their transactions instantly. Another feature Dash provides is PrivateSend, which provides enhanced privacy by mixing Dash of several holders before transmitting the Dash, thereby creating uncertainty regarding the source of the Dash being transferred (though transactions are still recorded on the blockchain and remain traceable when this feature is used). Utilizing PrivateSend makes it difficult for third parties to monitor the total value of a holder’s electronic wallet (described in detail below), thereby providing greater protection from increasingly frequent criminal attacks (both digital and physical) targeted at individuals and entities holding significant digital assets.  \n\n“Masternodes” are nodes that perform specialized functions on the Network, including processing InstantSend and PrivateSend transactions. Operators of masternodes receive compensation payable in Dash for performing such services (as described below). Any holder can operate a masternode or change an existing node into a masternode by downloading specific software, and demonstrating that such holder has a transaction output storing a sum of exactly 1,000 Dash. Masternode status is maintained for so long as the operator continues to hold that transaction output storing exactly 1,000 Dash and the masternode adequately services user requests. If the transaction output is used as an input in a transaction, the Network automatically strips the holder of its status as a masternode and its ability to carry out the specialized functions. In addition, masternodes are subject to proof-of-service; if masternodes fail to provide services to the network, they are banned from the masternode layer of the network and discontinue receiving compensation. Operators of masternodes maintain custody and control of the 1,000 Dash collateral at all times. The 1,000 Dash is not pooled or used for collective projects or investments, and they are not paid interest or dividends on their Dash. A holder can operate multiple masternodes provided that each masternode maintains the requisite 1,000 Dash. \n\nInstantSend details: https://blog.dash.org/deterministic-masternode-list-and-automatic-instantsend-now-live-f2028d833388 ;  PrivateSend details: https://docs.dash.org/en/stable/introduction/features.html#privatesendprivatesend;","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"PrivateSend audit","date":"2016-11-11T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"During this review, weaknesses, both from an architectural and implementation point of view, were discovered.

This ensures that all assets and intellectual property are under permanent control of the network itself, rather than any individual or company. Through on-chain governance (described below), the masternodes elect the trust protectors, who have the authority to direct the trustee to oversee Dash Core Group (e.g., assign the board of directors).  \n\nProposals generally begin life as simple pre-proposal forum posts on the Dash Forum, where feedback and suggestions are solicited from the general community. Once the proposal owner decides they have a reasonable chance of passing their proposal, it is created as a governance object on the blockchain. A fee of 5 DASH is associated with this action to prevent spam and ensure only serious proposals make it to this stage. Several tools exist to allow masternode operators to comfortably review and vote on proposals. The net total of yes votes must exceed 10% of the total masternode count at the time votes are tallied in order to pass. If there are more passing proposals than the available block reward can provide for, the proposals with the most yes votes will pass first, creating a cut-off point for less popular proposals. The same process is then repeated every month, and the total amount of Dash available for proposals decreases by approximately 7.14% per year, together with the overall block reward.  \n\nWebsites, such as DashCentral, Dash Nexus, and Dash Ninja are available to monitor progress over time and gather more detailed statistics. Dash Masternode Tool also allows for voting without the need to share masternode private keys with a third party service.  \n\nEach proposal includes a description of the proposal goals, details of what work will be done and a breakdown of the requested budget. Many proposals also link to their own website or the pre-proposal discussion, or include a video to validate the identity and sincerity of the proposal owner. Discussion on DashCentral and/or Dash Nexus occurs below this information, and masternode owners have the option to verify their ownership of a masternode and ability to cast a vote by signing a message from the masternode collateral address. Masternodes can vote at any time, and also change their vote at any time until the cutoff block is mined and voting stops. This occurs 1662 blocks prior to the superblock. After voting stops, the blockchain executes a decentralized tally and validates all votes. Once consensus is reached, the results are broadcast and the budget is allocated soon after in a superblock.  \n\nOnce passed, proposals are able to report back to the network on the Dash Forum or via published public channels and social media. Since it is possible to create proposals that pay out over several months, it is also possible to revoke funding from a project by changing the vote if development or spending of already allocated funds is unsatisfactory. This encourages proposal owners to work honestly and diligently to win the trust and approval of the network. Ongoing discussion and gradual improvement over time results in a close bond between the network and those working for the network in supporting roles.  \n\nVoting on proposals is updated in real time via P2P messages and stored by Dash in cache files, so current winning proposals and the total allocation of the available budget are always open and visible to everyone.   \n\nFinally, Dash Watch (which was itself funded through a budget proposal) exists to monitor the ability of blockchain contractors to deliver on their promises with respect to delivery dates and the total amounts of budget allocated over multiple voting periods. A team of dedicated staff routinely interact with proposal owners to track progress of the various projects and provide reports to voting masternodes in a single location. While providing data on the performance of a proposal to Dash Watch is optional, many masternode owners take advantage of the data they make available to make a voting decision.","onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":"Direct On-Chain Vote","onchain_governance_details":"Decentralized Governance by Blockchain, or DGBB, is Dash’s attempt to solve two important problems in cryptocurrency: governance and funding. Governance in a decentralized project is difficult, because by definition there are no central authorities to make decisions for the project. In Dash, such decisions are made by the network, that is, by the owners of masternodes. The DGBB system allows each masternode to cast a vote (yes/no/abstain) on each proposal. Proposals are most often regarding the allocation of the network's funding. If a proposal passes, the payment specified by the proposal is paid in a monthly \"superblock\" along with all the passing proposals that month. Decision proposals are occasionally submitted to the network for important or contentious decision. For example, the outcome of a vote can be used to determine whether a feature should be implemented (or not) by Dash’s developers. A key example is early in 2016, when Dash’s Core Team submitted a proposal to the network asking whether the blocksize should be increased to 2 MB. Within 24 hours, consensus had been reached to approve this change. Compare this to Bitcoin, where debate on the blocksize has been raging for nearly three years and has resulted in serious splits within the community and even forks to the Bitcoin blockchain.  \n\nThe DGBB also provides a means for Dash to fund its own development. While other projects have to depend on donations or premined endowments, Dash uses 10% of the block reward to fund its own development. Every time a block is mined, 45% of the reward goes to the miner, 45% goes to a masternode, and the remaining 10% is not created until the end of the month. During the month, anyone can submit a budget proposal to the network. If that proposal earns the net approval of at least 10% of the masternode network, then at the end of the month the requested amount will be paid out in the “superblock”. At that time, the block rewards that were not paid out (10% of each block) will be used to fund approved proposals. The network thus funds itself by reserving 10% of the block reward for budget projects.","is_treasury_decentralized":true},"grants":[{"funding_organizations":[],"grant_program_details":"See governance

At the time, CO, formerly known as Conformal Systems, was an open-source software engineering firm that focused on privacy and security oriented solutions including btcd (eventually migrated to btcsuite), an alternative full node Bitcoin implementation written in Go. In late 2015. C0 published a series of blog posts outlining challenges they saw in Bitcoin and proposals for iterating upon it. \n\nUltimately, on December 12, 2015, Decred was announced as a solution to Bitcoin's perceived problems, which included inefficient governance and capture by core developers, lack of development funding, and excessive miner power over the Bitcoin network. The proposal was for \"an open, progressive, and self-funding cryptocurrency with a system of community-based governance integrated into its blockchain.\" At the core of the project was a hybridized proof-of-work proof-of-stake (PoW/PoS) consensus system that aimed to strike a balance between PoW miners and PoS voters to create a more robust notion of consensus. \n\nOn February 8, 2016 the Decred mainnet launched along with the Decred constitution, a set of principles and guidelines that provide users a clear understanding of the social contract between themselves and the project. At launch, 8% of the total supply was pre-mined, with 4% used to compensate the developers and 4% air-dropped to 2,972 people who signed up. \n\nIn June 2017 Decred became the first blockchain to make a successful direct on-chain user-activated consensus vote. In October 2018 Decred's Politeia proposal system launched, allowing Decred users and stakeholders to propose, discuss, collaborate on, and fund new projects, initiatives, and consensus changes on an off-chain platform. Since then Politeia has been used for a wide range of governance decisions including research, bug bounties, and even public relations. Current initiatives launched on Politeia include privacy upgrades, support for Lightning Network, an expanded communications plan, and a decentralized exchange.","issuing_organizations":[{"slug":"company-0","name":"Company 0","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/Company%200%20Logo.PNG","description":"A Chicago-based developement group for Decred.

The first layer is powered by \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/nakamoto-consensus\"\u003eNakamoto Consensus\u003c/a\u003e, whereby the valid chain is the longest chain with the most accumulated PoW. The second layer is powered by PoS, whereby stakers validate blocks before appending them to the blockchain. The PoS layer acts as a check on miners, ensuring they do not submit deliberately empty or invalid blocks. The PoS layer is also used for Decred's governance process (see governance section for more detail).\n\nIn order to participate in PoS consensus one must stake DCR to receive tickets, a non-tradable cryptoasset on the Decred network. Up 20 new tickets are available for purchase each block, with the price of tickets adjusting dynamically every 144 blocks (~12 hours). The price of tickets adjusts in order to keep the Ticket Pool, total number of tickets on the Decred network, near the target pool size of 40,960 tickets. This is done to aid predictability in staking activity, so stakers need not worry about drastically fluctuating parameters that determine how frequently you get to participate in consensus.\n\nEach block 5 tickets are randomly selected by a Poisson distribution to validate blocks produced by POW miners, and vote on Decred governance proposals during voting periods. The average time it takes for a ticket to vote is 28 days, but possibly requiring up to 142 days, with a 0.5% chance of expiring before being chosen to vote (this expiration returns the original Ticket Price without a reward).\n\nMining\nMiners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks using the BLAKE-256 proof-of-work algorithm.

Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Decred's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Decred uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. Decred also uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism to validate blocks submitted by miners (and vote on Decred governance proposals). The PoS layer serves to provide a check on miner power.\n\nDecred is actively pursuing integration with the Lightning network. So users can initiate payments across Bitcoin’s network with its native token DCR and potentially hold multiple assets in Decredition, the Decred wallet solution. Additional steps required to release the decentralized exchange they are focused on building.\n\nCurrently, the project is adding support for Decentralized Autonomous Entities, DAEs, of which the Politeia is the first example.

Decred governance has its foundations in the Decred constitution - a set of principles and guidelines that provide users a clear understanding of the social contract between themselves and the project. \n\nThe Decred governance system is designed to allow the Decred community to decide upon anything ranging from protocol changes to decentralized treasury allocations. Governance in Decred works through a combination of on-chain and off-chain mechanisms.

However, to ensure transparency over what's being censored, All data on Politeia is periodically anchored into the Decred blockchain, using dcrtime, and users can prove censorship cryptographically if censorship occurs. Valid proposals appear publicly on Politeia, where discussion and revision take place. Once a proposal owner is confident in their proposal they can authorize voting on it. Owners authorize voting on their proposals by paying a 0.1 DCR fee.

Initial proposals for consensus changes are brought to life through the Politeia system in order to determine if the work necessary to create a working implementation, its associated Decred Change Proposal (DCP), and an on-chain vote for the rule change should be performed. Once a proposal has successfully gone through the Politea system, it then begins life as a DCP. DCPs are similar to \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-bip\"\u003eBIPs\u003c/a\u003e in Bitcoin.

If the proposal has a budget and deliverables attached to it the proposal owner can submit claims against the budget as deliverables are completed.\n\n__Consensus Rule Voting__\nOnce new software is released both PoW miners and PoS voters must independently adopt the software with the code changes; however, the code changes will lie dormant until the change has been voted upon.The voting period is activated once a target adoption threshold is reach for the PoW miners and PoS voters. The PoW upgrade is consdiered complete once 95% of the latest 1,000 blocks are mined with the latest version. The PoS upgrade is considered complete once 75% of the votes in a complete [stake version interval](https://docs.decred.org/glossary/#stake-version-interval-svi) (An interval which is used to determine if a vote on consensus rule changes can begin which occurs every 2,016 blocks or ~1 week) are cast using the latest version. Once both thresholds are met, voting is scheduled to begin on the first block of the next [rule change interval](https://docs.decred.org/glossary/#rule-change-interval-rci) (an interval in which ticket holders can vote on consensus rule changes that occurs every 8,064 blocks or ~4 weeks). \n\nOnce the voting period begins, ticket holders vote on the changes over a rule change interval. Every vote has a quorum requirement of 10% (voters who are not abstaining). If that requirement is met, a 75% \"Yes\" or \"No\" majority threshold is required for a vote to pass. If the outcome is \"Yes\", the consensus changes will automatically update 8,064 blocks after the vote passed. All participants in the Decred network must upgrade their software to the latest version during this window. If the outcome is \"No\", the consensus changes will never active. If the majority threshold is not met the consensus rule change will remain active for the next rule change interval. If it fails to reach an outcome again the consensus change will expire and never activate.

These loans are created by smart contracts that mint \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/dai\"\u003eDai\u003c/a\u003e, a stablecoin with a soft peg to the US dollar. The protocol was built by the Maker Foundation along with a number of outside parties and over time the foundation has worked to reduce its level of control. They have gradually ceded control to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) known as MakerDAO which governs the protocol. The DAO is comprised of individuals across the globe that own the MKR token which affords holders the right to vote on important changes.\n\nSingle Collateral Dai\nThe first iteration was known as Single Collateral Dai (SCD) because Ethereum was the only asset used as collateral to take out a loan. It launched in December 2017 and grew to support $100 million worth of debt. Despite a 94% decrease in the value of collateral over that time, the system remained healthy and Dai maintained a close peg to $1. Since Dai was the only widespread stablecoin that did not require a company to back it by holding US dollars, it became an integral piece of the growing decentralized finance ecosystem. While SCD proved to be effective, the intended goal was to transition to Multi Collateral Dai (MCD) that could accept collateral other than Dai as well as implement other key design changes.\n\nTransition to Multi Collateral Dai\nIn November 2019 MakerDAO \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/multi-collateral-dai-is-live\"\u003eupgraded\u003c/a\u003e the protocol to MCD with Basic Attention Token (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bat\"\u003eBAT\u003c/a\u003e) being voted as the first additional collateral available. The existing single collateral system continues to function as is while users are encouraged to migrate to the new Dai. Eventually, the single collateral system will be phased out altogether. In addition to the new collateral, MCD made other important design changes such as the introduction of the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) which allows Dai holders to earn yield and collateral auctions that create a competitive market for liquidations.\n\nInternal controversy\nTowards the end of 2018, the Maker Ecosystem Growth Fund (MEGF) was established to oversee the treasury of MKR tokens by nine board members chosen by the CEO Rune Christensen. According to a document from the former CTO Andy Milenius, titled ”Zandy’s Story”, after some disagreements as to how the fund was to be allocated, Rune presented two divergent choices. The “red pill” was for those who would follow his lead and focus on government compliance and integration into the existing financial system while the blue pill for those who didn’t want a formal organizational structure and would work on MCD and then cease to be funded. However, there was one group that wanted to explore alternative options that called themselves the Purple Pill. When this group was discovered it was seen as conspiratorial and five members of the board that were members of the Purple Pill group were subsequently fired. Those members then sent a legal letter stating they were wrongfully terminated.","issuing_organizations":[{"slug":"dai-foundation","name":"Maker Foundation","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1573689600%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3D40nJxrC4oLGXmtycZ_GxcpV-vcl7VijAqEtxnWpbXSE","description":"The Maker Foundation built the Maker protocol and created the initial supply of tokens.

A Vault is created by depositing collateral into a smart contract which then mints an amount of Dai specified by the user. The dollar value of the collateral must be greater than 150% the value of Dai (current Collateralization Ratio). The user can transact freely with their Dai. If they want to receive their initial collateral they must pay back both the Dai they withdrew plus the interest rate on the loan (Stability Fee). If at any point, the value of the collateral drops below the collateralization ratio, then their position is subject to liquidations where anyone can come in and purchase the underlying collateral to repay the debt. Known as Keepers, these actors are motivated by the profit opportunity from buying the collateral below market price and then selling on the open market.\n\nAuctions\nThere are three types of auctions\nSurplus Auctions occur when loans remain overcollateralized and payments from stability fees reach a certain amount. After that, Dai is auctioned off to Keepers for MKR which is then subsequently destroyed.\nCollateral Auctions occur when Vaults drop below the Collateralization Ratio. The collateral in the vault is then sold until the outstanding debt is repaid plus a liquidation penalty. At that point, the auction becomes a reverse auction, where a bidder bids on accepting smaller parts of collateral for that fixed amount of Dai. Once the process ends, the remaining collateral is returned to the vault owner.\nDebt Auctions occur in the worst-case scenario when the price of collateral drops precipitously such that it can no longer cover the entire debt paid. The system will first look towards the surplus from Stability Fees to cover the debt. If that is not sufficient, a reverse auction occurs to cover the fixed amount of Dai necessary to make the system whole. Bidders compete on willingness to accept decreasing amounts of MKR for the shortfall in Dai.\n\nDai Savings Rate (DSR)\nThe DSR was implemented in MCD as a way for Dai holders to earn interest on their holdings. Users can deposit Dai into a non-custodial smart contract and immediately begin earning interest funded by Stability Fee payments. They are also free to withdraw at any time. The DSR serves as a monetary policy tool for governance to control the outstanding supply of Dai in order to manage the $1 peg. If the peg were to drop below $1, MKR holders could vote to increase the DSR. This would incentivize Dai holders to lock more Dai up, decreasing the supply and ideally bringing the price back up.","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"Initial Audit","date":"2016-08-25T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Audit [performed](https://github.com/makerdao/audit-2/blob/master/makerdao_audit_aug_2016_public.pdf) by Peter Vessenes "},{"title":"Sai Security Assessment","date":"2017-10-24T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Audit [performed](https://makerdao.com/CodeReview/Sai_Final_Report.pdf) by Trail of Bits\n"},{"title":"Single-Collateral Dai","date":"2017-12-15T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Audit [performed](https://makerdao.com/saiCodeReview/SAI%20Coin%20Code%20Review_v1_3.pdf) by Jordi Baylina, Barry Whitehat, Adrià Massanet, Eduardo Antuña, Arthur Lunn, Antoni Martin, Griff Green"},{"title":"MCD smart contract audit report","date":"2019-10-04T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"PeckShield performed an [audit](https://github.com/makerdao/mcd-security/blob/master/Audit%20Reports/PeckShield_Final_Audit_Report.pdf) and discovered 16 issues of varying severities, none of which were thought to be critical.

"}]}},"governance":{"governance_details":"The Maker protocol is ultimately governed by the MKR holders, where one token equals one vote. Anyone is free to submit a proposal which then goes through a Governance Poll to establish rough community consensus. Polls can be proactive to account for one-off or intermittent issues that need to be addressed for future issues, or they can be reactive to respond to a present state change. Once there is general agreement, the issue is put up for an Executive Vote where MKR holders vote to enact the change.\n\nExamples of changes that can be made include:\nNew collateral types with their own unique risk parameters such as Collateralization Ratio and debt ceiling\nSelection of oracle feeds to input the market price of various collateral assets\nModifications to the Stability Fee or Dai Savings Rate\nAllocations of funds from the Maker Buffer which include the totally system’s revenues from Liquidation and Stability Fees\nTriggering Emergency Shutdown\n\nEmergency Shutdown\nA critical component of Maker governance is the Emergency Shutdown capability. It serves two functions: to shutdown the old system in the event of a major upgrade as we will see with single collateral Dai, or as a last resort mechanism in the event of any malicious governance activity, attack or security breach. Once 50,000 MKR are placed in the Emergency Shutdown Module, it is enacted immediately to shut down the system and return collateral to Dai holders and Vault owners. Vault owners can withdraw their collateral minus the Dai debt owed which is then available for Dai holders through the main collateral claim process. This is a manual process where Dai holders use Dai to claim collateral at a fixed rate corresponding to the calculated value based on the Dai Target Price. In receiving their proportional claim of the collateral portfolio they could be at risk of a haircut due to the risk in decline of collateral value.\n\nGovernance Security Module (GSM)\nAfter an Executive Vote gets passed, there is a 24-hour delay period before the change gets deployed to give stakeholders time to review the code and maintain the integrity of the system. If they believe the change is detrimental to the system, MKR holders can opt for an Emergency Shutdown so that all stakeholders receive their fair value currently locked in the system.\n\nMakerDAO hosts weekly governance calls on Thursdays 4pm UTC","onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":"Direct On-Chain Vote","onchain_governance_details":"While Governance Polls are conducted over discrete time periods to gauge community consensus, Executive Votes are continuous and represent the state of the system at all times. At any point in time, a proposal can be introduced that represents a new state of the protocol, which means MKR holders must continuously monitor for these changes and vote accordingly. In order to vote, MKR holders need to keep their tokens in a voting construct where they are then free to shift to competing proposals. Therefore the expectation is that MKR holders will play an active role in governance, deciding how the system evolves over time.","is_treasury_decentralized":false},"grants":[{"funding_organizations":[{"slug":null,"name":"The Maker Foundation","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1573689600%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3D40nJxrC4oLGXmtycZ_GxcpV-vcl7VijAqEtxnWpbXSE","description":null}],"grant_program_details":"The Maker Foundation sponsors both the [Meetup Grants](https://community-development.makerdao.com/meetups) and [Development Grants Program ](https://community-development.makerdao.com/grants)which are both funded through the Foundation's reserves.

They incorporated the company behind Zilliqa (called Zilliqa Research) in Jun. 2017, a few months before the team launched its first testnet.\n\nZilliqa brings the theory of sharding to practice with a protocol that aims to address the scalability limitations seen in some other blockchains. Its sharded design allows concurrent chains to execute transactions in parallel, thereby increasing the overall capacity of the network. The team’s primary motivation in building this product was to create a platform that could process \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\"\u003esmart contracts\u003c/a\u003e at scale without sacrificing core blockchain principles, such as the decentralization of node management.\n\nZilliqa uses a modified version of the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/proof-of-work\"\u003eProof-of-Work\u003c/a\u003e (PoW) consensus protocol to order and validate transactions, as well as provide security assurances for completed transactions. According to the team, this modified consensus model provides a more cost-effective version of mining when compared to other networks in the market.\n\nZilliqa's smart contract layer features a proprietary programming language called Scilla, which allows developers to write and express the conditions of smart contracts conveniently. This infrastructure is being used to develop both pilot and commercial applications in the areas of security token offerings, gaming, domain registry service, financial services, and payment reconciliation in advertising.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Whitepaper released","date":"2017-08-10T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Technical whitepaper"},{"title":"Scilla design document","date":"2018-01-02T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Scilla is the new smart contract language for Zilliqa"},{"title":"Zilliqa source code released","date":"2018-01-01T05:00:00Z","type":"Event","details":null},{"title":"Final Testnet released","date":"2018-11-30T05:00:00Z","type":"Testnet Launch","details":"Community can spin up their own nodes and mine"},{"title":"Zilliqa v4.0.1 release (Mainnet Launch)","date":"2019-01-31T05:00:00Z","type":"Network Launch","details":"The Zilliqa released used for mainnet.

The token swap process lasted several months, ending on Feb. 15, 2020. Several exchanges, including Binance, KuCoin, OKEx, Huobi, CoinHako, Upbit, and Bitthumb, facilitate the swap.\n\nFollowing the deadline, Zilliqa reported that exchanges successfully swapped ~98.3% of the 12.6 billion ERC-20 ZIL. The leftover ERC-20 tokens, totaling over 213 million ZIL or 1.02% of the max 21 million supply, remained unswapped and would be frozen.\n\nOn Jun. 16, 2020, Zilliqa said it is considering potential solutions for users still holding their now frozen ERC-20 ZIL. According to the team, it might be possible to coordinate with an exchange or custodial wallet who could facilitate an exchange to mainnet ZIL post-token swap deadline. Zilliqa plans to identify a partner, but the process might take several months. More details should be available towards the end of 2020.\n\nLearn more:\nZilliqa Monthly Newsletter — January 2020\nToken Swap End announcement"},{"title":"Staking contract on mainnet","date":"2020-07-15T04:00:00Z","type":"Economics","details":"Zilliqa aims to introduce a staking mechanism via ZIP-3 by allowing Seed Nodes, which serve as access points for end-user clients, to stake ZIL on the network in exchange for part of the block reward.

When Zilliqa's mainnet launched in January 2019, block rewards were split into base rewards (25%) for all validating nodes in the network and flexible rewards (70%) that are based on the amount of valid and accepted signatures submitted by a node during a transaction epoch. The last 5% of rewards are allocated to the lookup and seed nodes. The entirety of the Mining rewards are already pre-mined and will be distributed over a ten-year period.\n\nSeed Node Staking Changes\nIn June 2020, Zilliqa introduced a new staking contract (via ZIP-3), which allows Seed Nodes to distribute their percentage of the block reward to direct or delegate stakers. There were only ten seed nodes when the contract went leive, and each one was eligible to receive enough delegate tokens to stake up to 61 million tokens. Therefore, the number of tokens available for staking in first phase of Zilliqa's new staking contract tops out at 610 million ZIL. \n\nWhen ZIP-3 launched, Seed Nodes continued to receive 5% of all block rewards, a portion of which they passed down to delegate stakers in proportion to the number of tokens locked up. But in November 2020, Zilliqa executed ZIP-9 to overhaul the distribution block rewards. Under this new policy, miners only 60% of block rewards while the remaining share goes to Seed Nodes and their delegates. Zilliqa increase the rewards for stakers to incentivize more stakers to join the network. The Zilliqa also increased the block reward by 40% to offset any losses suffered by miners due to the new block reward split. Therefore, the network will now reach its maximum supply much sooner than originally intended.","general_emission_type":"Inflationary","precise_emission_type":"Fixed Inflation rate","is_capped_supply":true,"max_supply":21000000000},"consensus":{"consensus_details":"Zilliqa’s network consists of several groups of nodes, each called a shard. A special shard among these is referred to as a Directory Service (DS) committee. The DS committee acts as a supervisory shard and helps in the formation of shards and aggregate transaction validation results from each shard among others.\n\nZilliqa leverages on the shards for parallel processing of transactions. Each shard and the DS committee run an optimized practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (pBFT) for consensus on valid transactions.\n\nNOTE: In pBFT, there is a deterministic finality of blocks, unlike the probabilistic finality in \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/nakamoto-consensus\"\u003eNakamoto consensus\u003c/a\u003e (like \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\"\u003e$BTC\u003c/a\u003e). Therefore, there is no need for several block confirmation, the latest state of the latest block is the “truth” of the chain.\n\nZilliqa miners receive block rewards based on how many valid signatures they contributed. According to the team, this makes ZIL rewards low-variance and potentially allows for a more equal distribution of tokens by way of block rewards.\n\nLearn more:\nZilliqa Mining Guide\nNode Explorer (ViewBlock Zilliqa block explorer)","general_consensus_mechanism":"Other","precise_consensus_mechanism":"Proof-of-Work \u0026 pBFT","targeted_block_time":43,"block_reward":null,"mining_algorithm":"Ethash","next_halving_date":null,"is_victim_of_51_percent_attack":false}},"native_treasury":{"accounts":[],"treasury_usage_details":null}},"technology":{"overview":{"technology_details":"Zilliqa focuses on scalability through a process called sharding. While many current blockchain applications utilize every node on a network to process every transaction, Zilliqa divides the network into different shards, each processing a subset of the network’s transactions and requiring only some miners working on those transactions at any given time. This reduces wasted computational resources related to nodes confirming transactions that may have already been verified by thousands of others. \n\nSharding is also applied to smart contract processing, in that only subsets of the entire network resources are used to perform any given computation. Using this technology Zilliqa expects their throughput to roughly double with the addition of every couple hundred miners. \n\nZilliqa uses standard \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\"\u003eProof-of-Work (PoW)\u003c/a\u003e for security in its network, but it has a two-layer blockchain structure to allow for more efficient use of computing resources. To create an identity or participate in sharding on a user must show proof-of-work but this is not used to achieve consensus. Instead, Zilliqa employs a consensus protocol known as practical Byzantine fault tolerance. In this protocol, nodes are grouped with a leader that is responsible for broadcasting both transactions and decisions. When two-thirds of nodes in a shard cast their votes, the leader commits an answer. Leader nodes are changed continuously to prevent malicious leaders from having an undue effect on the network. \n\nUnlike Ethereum, Zilliqa does not have a Turing-complete smart contract language. Their smart contract language Scilla was designed with safety in mind and is amenable to formal verification. Zilliqa cites neural nets as being a prime example of a computation that would be best served by their language, as on any other network it would likely be prohibitively expensive. \n\nIn the future, Zilliqa plans to research on a significant number of new technologies including: \nState sharding – Allowing the data stored by the network to be divided in the same way as the processing and consensus layers. \nSecure Proof-of-Stake (SPoS) – A security mechanism that distributes consensus power to the most heavily invested nodes in the network. \nStorage pruning – A mechanism for reducing the total amount of data required to store in order to participate in the network. This can eliminate spam and dated blocks from the required data. \nPrivacy-preserving computation – Computation that removes the identity requirement of participating in the network, so computation is not tied to an account on the blockchain\n","client_repositories":[{"name":"Zilliqa","link":"\"https://github.com/Zilliqa/Zilliqa\t\"\t\t","license_type":"GPL v3.0"}]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"ERC20 contract audit 1","date":null,"type":null,"details":"[https://docs.zilliqa.com/ZKLabs-Zilliqa-Audit.pdf](https://docs.zilliqa.com/ZKLabs-Zilliqa-Audit.pdf)"},{"title":"ERC20 contract audit 2","date":null,"type":null,"details":"[https://docs.zilliqa.com/ChainSecurity-Zilliqa-Audit.pdf](https://docs.zilliqa.com/ChainSecurity-Zilliqa-Audit.pdf)"},{"title":"Zilliqa core security audit","date":null,"type":null,"details":"N/A"}],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":"Rough consensus is mainly driven by Zilliqa Research and core developers.\n\nSee the Zilliqa governance discussion Discord channel for the latest updates.","onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":"No On-Chain Governance","onchain_governance_details":null,"is_treasury_decentralized":false},"grants":[{"funding_organizations":[],"grant_program_details":"Zilliqa's ecosystem arm, ZILHive, has a pool of $5 million, which it uses to issue grants to projects, teams, and individuals building on the Zilliqa blockchain.

Enjin utilizes a GraphQL-based API that enables game developers to facilitate the smart contract interactions and other services related to interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nAdditionally, Enjin utilizes a backend service called “Trusted Cloud” that acts as the cloud-hosting service that connects games to Ethereum. Enjin’s Trusted Cloud acts as a proxy that gathers requests from clients and game servers and returns the data back to each game. Enjin’s cloud service also links user’s existing game accounts (i.e. SteamID, X-box live) to a block wallet address.\n\nEnjin’s crypto wallet connects directly to the Enjin Platform and stores all the digital items for games built on Enjin’s Platform. The Enjin wallet must be used for all games on the Enjin platform because it directly links an Ethereum address to an Enjin Platform user identity. The gaming company is also developing \"Wallet Daemon\", a tool that automates transaction requests to and from the Enjin Platform. Additionally, the Enjin wallet enables a QR service for purchasing or receiving ERC-1155 denominated assets.\n\nCreating any blockchain asset on the Enjin Platform requires spending Enjin Coin. Game developers have the potential to customize the amount of Enjin Coin an in-game item is worth as well as the desired fungibility of each item. Assets and items created for games on the Enjin Platform can always be exchanged back into Enjin coins by users or game developers.\n\nEnjin is also developing an Ethereum scaling solution called Efinity that will be utilized within the Enjin Platform. The company claims games will be able to open channels within the Efinity network that will enhance the speed of relaying information between smart contracts and game servers.

Due to the Zerocoin protocol's novelty and computational intensity, however, Bitcoin core developers deemed it impractical for implementation into the Bitcoin protocol. Subsequently, with additional improvements to the protocol that resulted in substantially more efficient zero knowledge proofs, Zerocoin's founding scientists from John Hopkins in collaboration with researchers from MIT and Tel Aviv University created a new protocol called \"Zerocash\" (Zcash). Upon recruiting it's CEO, Zooko Wilcox, to head the project and raising over $3mm in venture funding through two fundraises, the Zcash protocol began development under the Zcash Company, with the objective of building the Zcash protocol into a full-fledged cryptocurrency. In 2017, a separate entity, the Zcash Foundation was incorporated as a 501(c)3 nonprofit with the mission to build internet payment and privacy infrastructure for the public good, primarily serving the users of the Zcash protocol and blockchain  In 2019, the Zcash Company rebranded to the Electric Coin Company.\n\nZcash was conceived from the observation that Bitcoin could not offer strong privacy guarantees, with transactions recorded in a public decentralized ledger, from which significant information can be deduced. At the core of Zcash technology are zero-knowledge proofs, which allow transaction data to be validated without revealing information about the amount and the parties involved. With Zcash users can selectively share address and transaction information for auditing or regulatory compliance through the use of view keys and payment disclosure. Through the use of zero-knowledge proofs, Zcash aims to create a truly fungible, privacy preserving cryptocurrency.\n\nZcash is built on strong science and audited by third parties. It is an open-source protocol, built by a security-specialized engineering team, and originally based on Bitcoin Core's codebase.","issuing_organizations":[{"slug":"electric-coin-company","name":"Electric Coin Company","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/ECC-icon-fullcolor.png","description":"The Electric Coin Company is a for-profit entity that launched and supports the development of Zcash"},{"slug":"zcash-foundation","name":"Zcash Foundation","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/a3Aw6vOK_400x400.jpg","description":"A non-profit organization dedicated to financial privacy through technology"}]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Overwinter","date":"2018-06-01T04:00:00Z","type":"Mainnet","details":"Versioning, replay protection for network upgrades, performance improvements for transparent transactions, and a new feature of transaction expiry"},{"title":"Sapling","date":"2018-10-01T04:00:00Z","type":"Mainnet","details":"Drastically reduces the amount of time and memory needed for constructing zk-SNARKs"},{"title":"Blossom","date":"2019-12-11T05:00:00Z","type":"Mainnet","details":"The Blossom upgrade will cut block times in half to around 75 seconds.

A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (mempool) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.\n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Zcash's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Zcash uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated “work” (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. Other network peers can cheaply verify the chain’s work\n\nIn order to have zero-knowledge privacy in Zcash, the function determining the validity of a transaction according to the network’s consensus rules must return the answer of whether the transaction is valid or not, without revealing any of the information it performed the calculations on. This is done by encoding some of the network’s consensus rules in zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge). Zk-SNARKs are specific zero-knowledge proofs whereby one can prove possession of certain information, e.g. a secret key, without revealing that information, and without any interaction between the prover and verifier. \n\nZcash addresses are either private (z-addresses) or transparent (t-addresses). Z-addresses start with a “z,” and t-addresses start with a \"t.\" The two Zcash address types are interoperable, and funds can be transferred between z-addresses and t-addresses. A Z-to-Z transaction appears on the public blockchain, so it is known to have occurred and that the fees were paid. But the addresses, transaction amount and the memo field are all encrypted and not publicly visible. Transactions between two transparent addresses (t-addresses) work just like Bitcoin: The sender, receiver and transaction value are publicly visible. The owner of an address may choose to disclose z-address and transaction details with trusted third parties using view keys and payment disclosure. \n","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"Security Audit","date":"2016-09-02T04:00:00Z","type":"Mainnet","details":"[https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/zcash-cryptography-and-code-review/?research=Public+Reports](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/zcash-cryptography-and-code-review/?research=Public+Reports)"},{"title":"Security Audit","date":"2016-10-31T04:00:00Z","type":"Mainnet","details":"[https://coinspect.com/doc/CoinspectReportZcash2016.pdf](https://coinspect.com/doc/CoinspectReportZcash2016.pdf)"},{"title":"Proof-of-work Analysis","date":"2016-11-18T05:00:00Z","type":"Mining Algorithm","details":"[https://www.openwall.com/articles/Zcash-Equihash-Analysis](https://www.openwall.com/articles/Zcash-Equihash-Analysis)"},{"title":"MPC Ceremony (Sprout) Audit","date":"2017-09-21T04:00:00Z","type":"MPC Ceremony","details":"[https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/zcash-ceremony-and-audit/?research=Public+Reports](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/zcash-ceremony-and-audit/?research=Public+Reports)"},{"title":"Sapling Parameter Generation Security Proof","date":"2018-05-18T04:00:00Z","type":"MPC Ceremony","details":"[https://github.com/zcash/sapling-security-analysis/blob/master/MaryMallerUpdated.pdf](https://github.com/zcash/sapling-security-analysis/blob/master/MaryMallerUpdated.pdf)"},{"title":"Implementation Analysis (1.0.15) and Overwinter Specification Review","date":"2018-05-29T04:00:00Z","type":"Mainnet","details":"[https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority-Zcash-Implementation-Analysis-and-Overwinter-Specification.pdf](https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority-Zcash-Implementation-Analysis-and-Overwinter-Specification.pdf)"},{"title":"Zcash Overwinter+Sapling Specification","date":"2018-08-17T04:00:00Z","type":"Mainnet","details":"[https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority-Zcash-Overwinter+Sapling-Specification-Final-Audit-Report.pdf](https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority-Zcash-Overwinter+Sapling-Specification-Final-Audit-Report.pdf)"},{"title":"Zcash Source Code Review","date":"2018-12-31T05:00:00Z","type":"Mainnet","details":"[https://coinspect.com/doc/CoinspectReportZcash2018.pdf](https://coinspect.com/doc/CoinspectReportZcash2018.pdf)"},{"title":"Zcash Sapling Implementation / RPC Interface","date":"2019-01-30T05:00:00Z","type":"Mainnet","details":"[https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority-Zcash-Sapling-Implementation-RPC-Interface-Updated-Audit-Report.pdf](https://leastauthority.com/static/publications/LeastAuthority-Zcash-Sapling-Implementation-RPC-Interface-Updated-Audit-Report.pdf)"},{"title":"Zcash Sapling Security Audit","date":"2019-01-30T05:00:00Z","type":"Mainnet","details":"[https://cybermashup.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/zcash-audit.pdf](https://cybermashup.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/zcash-audit.pdf)"},{"title":"Sapling audit","date":"2019-01-31T05:00:00Z","type":"Mainnet","details":"[https://medium.com/qed-it/sapling-audit-9b531be9d30](https://medium.com/qed-it/sapling-audit-9b531be9d30)"},{"title":"Zcash Overwinter Consensus and Sapling Cryptography Review","date":"2019-01-31T05:00:00Z","type":"Mainnet","details":"[https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/zcash-overwinter-consensus-and-sapling-cryptography-review/?research=Public+Reports](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/zcash-overwinter-consensus-and-sapling-cryptography-review/?research=Public+Reports)"},{"title":"2018 Security Audit Results in Detail","date":"2019-01-31T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"[https://z.cash/blog/2018-security-audit-results-in-detail/](https://z.cash/blog/2018-security-audit-results-in-detail/)"},{"title":"Known Attack Vectors","date":null,"type":null,"details":"[https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/security_warnings.html](https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/security_warnings.html)"}],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":"Zcash is an open source community; historically most protocol development is largely handled by The Electric Coin Company. The Electric Coin Company maintains “zcashd,” the only production-ready node implementation. Protocol development is governed by the Zcash Improvement Proposal process (ZIP) whereby anyone in the open source Zcash community can submit draft ZIPs. After discussion by the Zcash community, the ZIP editors, features are selected for the upcoming network upgrade. Daira Hopwood, Principal Engineer of the Electric Coin Company and George Tankersley, Director of Engineering of the Zcash Foundation, accept or reject the ZIPs. Decisions from the ZIP process are written into the Zcash specification, as well as the software that runs the network. Finally, protocol changes are “ratified” on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus.\n\nThe Electric Coin Company and the Zcash Foundation are the two organizations who receive an allocation of the founder’s reward every block until the 850,000th block is mined at which point they will have cumulatively received 10% of the 21 million ZEC that will ever be mined. The Electric Coin Company is a for-profit organization that launched and supports the Zcash protocol. The Zcash foundation is a 501(c)3 public charity, dedicated to building internet payment and privacy infrastructure for the public good. Moving forward the Zcash foundation plans further decentralize the Zcash project through promoting competing node implementations, increasing community involvement, and ultimately reducing the influence of both itself and the Electric Coin Company on the Zcash protocol. Meaningful steps to this end include the Electric Coin Company donating the Zcash trademark to Zcash Foundation and the Development Fund discussion that is currently underway and will go into effect in October 2020","onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":null,"onchain_governance_details":null,"is_treasury_decentralized":false},"grants":[{"funding_organizations":[{"slug":null,"name":"ZCash Foundation","logo":"https://www.zfnd.org/images/logo-white-background.png","description":null}],"grant_program_details":"Funds proposals that support both the Mission and Values of the Zcash Foundation.

This makes the asset susceptible to the receiving party accidentally sending those Bitcoins to another wallet and ultimately end up losing those assets.

The DAO was an Ethereum-based venture fund that managed to raise ~$150 million in Ether in an April 2016 \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/initial-coin-offering-ico\"\u003einitial coin offering (ICO)\u003c/a\u003e.  A few months later (July 2016), an attacker exploited a bug in one of The DAO's smart contracts, enabling the hacker to steal 3.6 million ETH of the funds collected in its ICO.\n\nA divide in the community formed around how to resolve the issue. One camp believed reverting the chain, thus erasing the hack from the network's history, was necessary to preserve the longevity of Ethereum. The other side reasoned mutability was antithetical to the ethos of crypto networks and refused to accept a ledger rewrite. The divide led to a contentious hard fork at block 1,920,001, and the legacy chain that did not reverse its transaction history rebranded to Ethereum Classic.\n\nBefore the DAO fork split the original Ethereum chain, there was just one group of users, service providers, developers, investors, and other network participants. The hard fork or \"irregular state change\" split not only the protocol layer but also the social and application layers. As the legacy chain, Ethereum Classic inherited the components outlined within the Ethereum whitepaper. At the time of the fork, Ethereum Classic was still identical to Ethereum regarding these original components. However, it soon began to diverge away from Ethereum by announcing its own roadmap and vision.\n\nPhilosophy and monetary policy change\nThe Ethereum Classic (ETC) community stresses the core principals of censorship resistance and (most prominently) immutability. And as a continuation of the Ethereum blockchain, it features a Turing-complete \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\"\u003esmart contract\u003c/a\u003e language to support the development of more complex \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\"\u003edecentralized applications (dApps)\u003c/a\u003e. The Ethereum Classic community governs the network by the motto \"Code is Law,\" which instills the belief that ETC transactions and dApps are truly censorship-resistant and immune to any third party interference.\n\nETC later (March 2017) adopted a new, Bitcoin-like monetary policy fit with a fixed supply cap and disinflationary emission schedule. The proposal drastically deviated from the original Ethereum monetary policy, which remains in flux as Ethereum core devs look to establish a more concrete economic model for its future \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-stake\"\u003eProof of Stake (PoS)\u003c/a\u003e network. Instead of monetary flexibility (and some uncertainty), Ethereum Classic now features a max supply of 210,700,000 tokens and miner reward reductions every five million blocks. And unlike Ethereum, the community intends to stick with \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\"\u003eProof of Work (PoW)\u003c/a\u003e as its consensus and token issuance mechanism.  \n\nDevelopment teams and future developments\nETC's structure varies from most blockchain projects, incorporating multiple development teams (IOHK, ETC Labs, and ETC Cooperative), each with their own goals. In general, most of these teams have focused on providing sidechain \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/scaling\"\u003escaling\u003c/a\u003e solutions, improving development tools (SDKs), and promoting cross-chain transactions so others can build on Ethereum Classic. Some of these efforts, including Connext's state channels and ChainSafe's bridge to Ethereum and Cosmos SDK-based chains, have already launched.\n\nETC is one of the few cryptocurrencies where investors can gain exposure to it through a traditional brokerage and or retirement account. Grayscale Investments created an Ethereum Classic Investment Trust (ticker ETCG) that allows investors to gain exposure to ETC without having to store or secure it directly.\n\n51% attacks\nAs a minority chain using the Ethash mining algorithm, Ethereum Classic has been the target of multiple 51% attacks. The first attack occurred in Jan. 2019, when crypto exchange Coinbase \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/updated-ethereum-classic-has-experienced-multiple-100-reorg-attack-ethereum-classic-claims-not-an-attack-new-miners-being-tested-coinbase-rebuts\"\u003edetected\u003c/a\u003e a deep chain reorganization of the Ethereum Classic blockchain. The number of identified reorganizations eventually increased to a total of fifteen, twelve of which contained double spends, totaling 219,500 ETC (~$1.1 million).\n\nIn Aug. 2020, Ethereum Classic suffered three more 51% attacks. The first one resulted in a successful double-spend of 807,260 ETC (~$5.6 million at the time). The second attack occurred less than a week later and exhibited a similar reorg depth (about 4,000 blocks). The final Aug. 2020 attack resulted in a large reorg of 7,000 blocks, but there is no sign of a double-spend attempt as of yet. As for a possible solution, the ETC Cooperative would like to switch Ethereum Classic's hashing algorithm from Ethash to either Keccak-256 or SHA-3, which would mean Ethereum Classic would no longer be a minority chain and would potentially be less susceptible to similar attacks.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Ethereum Launches","date":"2015-07-30T04:00:00Z","type":"Network Launch","details":"Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum Foundation create the first blockchain-based, Turing-complete smart contract platform"},{"title":"The DAO Hard Fork","date":"2016-07-20T04:00:00Z","type":"Hard Fork","details":"The DAO hard fork activates at block 1,920,000, with around 80% of network nodes updating to the new client."},{"title":"Ethereum Classic Split and Rebrand","date":"2016-07-20T04:00:00Z","type":"Network Launch","details":"The hard fork split the original Ethereum chain into two separate networks.

Both the OpenEthereum and Hyperledger Besu teams have since released fixes to address these syncing and stability issues.

Quick block times lead to a higher stale or orphan rate, which can split mining resources among competing forks and reduce overall network security. Accelerated confirmation times also increases the likelihood a single \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/mining\"\u003emining\u003c/a\u003e pool could obtain a majority of the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/hash-power\"\u003ehash power\u003c/a\u003e on a given chain.\n\nThe GHOST protocol attempts to solve this issue of network security by including \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/orphan-block\"\u003eorphan blocks\u003c/a\u003e in the calculation of the longest chain. Therefore, the GHOST model determines the valid chain byweighingthe parent and further ancestors as well as the number of stale descendants. The protocol also rewards the mining of orphan blocks directly connected to the longest chain to combat potential centralization concerns. Orphan block miners do not receive any transaction fees, only a portion of the block subsidy, as stale transactions are not considered valid.\n\nMining\nEthereum Classic miners solve computational puzzles to generate new blocks by running the Ethash \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\"\u003eProof-of-Work (PoW)\u003c/a\u003e algorithm. In this process, miners compete to discover a valid hash as defined by the network's \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/difficulty-level\"\u003edifficulty adjustment\u003c/a\u003e algorithm. Ethereum Classic recalculates its difficulty level every block based on the time between the two previous blocks.\n\nCryptographers designed Ethash to be \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/blog/application-specific-integrated-circuits-asics\"\u003eASIC\u003c/a\u003e-resistant by making it memory intensive for specialized mining chips. But the popularity of Ethereum led mining chip manufacturer Bitmain to release the first ASICs miners for Ethash in April 2018. Since Ethereum and Ethereum Classic share the same mining algorithm at the moment, ASIC miners on Ethereum can shift their hash power over to Ethereum Classic to mine ETC. This opportunity combined with lower security spend on Ethereum Classic likely led to the various \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/51-attack\"\u003e51% attacks\u003c/a\u003e registered on Ethereum Classic, the first of which occurred in Jan. 2019 followed by three more in Aug. 2020.\n\nLearn more:\nEthereum Classic Node Documentation\nETC Nodes (Ethereum Classic Node Tracker","general_consensus_mechanism":"Proof-of-Work","precise_consensus_mechanism":null,"targeted_block_time":15,"block_reward":4,"mining_algorithm":"Ethash","next_halving_date":"2022-04-15T00:00:00Z","is_victim_of_51_percent_attack":true}},"native_treasury":{"accounts":[],"treasury_usage_details":null}},"technology":{"overview":{"technology_details":"Ethereum Classic (ETC) kept most of the original Ethereum technical features and architecture. It remains an account-based blockchain (as opposed to Bitcoin's \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/utxo\"\u003eUTXO\u003c/a\u003e model) consisting of external accounts, which are controlled by a user’s private keys, and contract accounts, which are managed by contract code. External contracts can create and sign messages to send to both types of accounts, while contract accounts can only execute transactions automatically in response to a message they have received. The latter are what are known as \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\"\u003esmart contracts\u003c/a\u003e and enable the programmability of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\"\u003edecentralized applications (dApps)\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nEthereum Classic also continues to use the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/ethereum-virtual-machine\"\u003eEthereum Virtual Machine (EVM)\u003c/a\u003e, the smart contract execution engine. It is a Turing-complete virtual machine featuring a specific language “EVM bytecode,” typically written in a higher-level language called Solidity or others such as the Python-based Vyper. Every operation on the EVM requires computational effort and memory. Ethereum Classic node operators and miners provide these resources to application developers and network users in exchange for gas.\n\nThe fee to make transactions or execute smart contract operations on ETC is (gas price) * (gas limit), and fees are paid to miners for including your transactions in a block. The gas limit is the maximum amount of gas users are willing to spend on a transaction, whereas the gas price is the cost users are willing to pay for each gas unit. A normal transaction on the network costs 21,000 gas but costs more if you are trying to execute something more complex as that requires more computational power. Users can also speed up their transactions by raising the gas price since that will incentivize miners to include the transaction(s) in the next block to receive those fees.\n\nEthereum Classic (ETC) uses Ethash as its \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-work\"\u003eProof-of-Work (PoW)\u003c/a\u003e algorithm. New blocks are generated every 15 seconds, on average, and the current miner reward for each new block found is 3.2 ETC which is reduced by 20% every 5 million blocks (about 2.4 years). ETC will be mineable until around 2070 when miners will reach the soft supply cap of between 210 million and 230 million. In addition to miner rewards, ETC rewards miners for discovering “uncle blocks”. Uncle blocks are valid blocks that arrived too late, meaning another miner already solved the PoW and claimed that block height's reward. This practice aims to decrease mining centralization, reduce the chance of unintentional forks, and boost network security. Every new block can contain at most two uncle blocks. Uncle block rewards are 3.125% of the miners' reward or 0.125 ETC.","client_repositories":[{"name":"Core-Geth","link":"https://github.com/etclabscore/core-geth","license_type":"LGPL 3.0"},{"name":"Hyperledger Besu","link":"https://github.com/hyperledger/besu","license_type":"Apache 2.0"},{"name":"Mantis","link":"https://github.com/input-output-hk/mantis","license_type":"Apache 2.0"}]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"IOHK Mantis Security Audit","date":"2018-01-26T00:00:00Z","type":"Client Security","details":"Kudelski Security Research ran a security audit of the Mantis client implementation codebase.\n\n[Full Audit Report](https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2018/01/26/audit-report-of-iohks-etc-wallet/)"},{"title":"ETC Multi-Sig Bug Audit","date":"2018-02-12T00:00:00Z","type":"Contract Security","details":"Dexaran of Ethereum Commonwealth completed an audit of the Ethereum Classic multi-sig wallet, which is an implementation of Open Zeppelin's [multi-sig contract code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/v1.2.0/contracts/MultisigWallet.sol).\n\n[Full Audit Report](https://gist.github.com/Dexaran/2389d5e7290ab69709d33abfe0485bec)"}],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[{"title":"Classic Ether Wallet hack","date":"2017-06-29T04:00:00Z","type":"Hack","details":"On 29 June 2017, the Ethereum Classic Twitter account made a public statement indicating a reason to believe that the website for Classic Ether Wallet had been compromised.

RenVM is intended to be a decentralized and trustless custodian that holds your digital assets as they move between blockchains using zero-knowledge proofs over an sMPC based protocol. The state, inputs, and outputs of all programs that RenVM runs are kept hidden from everyone, including the Darknodes that power it. \n\nThis allows RenVM to securely manage \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/elliptic-curve-digital-signature-algorithm-ecdsa\"\u003eECDSA\u003c/a\u003e private keys on different blockchains, making it possible to shift digital assets between blockchains in a trustless, permissionless, and decentralized way.\n\nNodes that power RenVM, are referred to as Darknodes. These can be operated by any member of the public that posts a bond of 100,000 Ren tokens (REN). Projects that utilize RenVM pay a small fee to Darknodes for providing interoperability. Given the one billion maximum REN token supply (ERC-20), there is a maximum of 10,000 possible Darknodes.\n\nRen is currently in phase sub-zero where there is only one group of nodes responsible for consensus and execution and it is run by the Ren team.

At the center of the problem are middlemen and cross-party data sharing, which have introduced a wide-range of problems for publishers, advertisers and users. Users have lost their privacy, pay high charges to download ads, and experience slow page load times. Publishers have lost billions in revenue to new middlemen. Advertisers face poor reporting and targeting.\n\nTo address these issues Eich and Bondy outlined a new vision for digital advertising. With Brave they aim to fix the digital advertising industry through disintermediating middlemen, enhancing user privacy, and distributing economic value more equitably across the digital advertising ecosystem. \n\nIn January 2016, Brave launched the first version of Brave with a built in ad-blocking feature. With Brave user's browsing data is kept private, with third party trackers being automatically blocked. By August 2016, the company had received at more than $7 million in funding from prominent venture firms, including Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, Propel Venture Partners, Pantera Capital, Foundation Capital, and the Digital Currency Group.\n\nBasic Attention Token Launch\nThe Brave browser's tipping feature initially supported Bitcoin; however, due to concerns over Bitcoin's scalability, the project pivoted to a new cryptocurrency that could meet the needs of the burgeoning Brave ecosystem. In a blog post released in March 2017 Brave announced a new blockchain-based digital advertising platform using an innovative Ethereum-based utility token called Basic Attention Token (BAT). \n\nJust months after announcing the project, in May 2017, Brave launched BAT, selling 1 billion tokens in an \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/initial-coin-offering-ico\"\u003eInitial Coin Offering\u003c/a\u003e (ICO), raising more than $35 million in just 30 minutes. The company set aside the remaining 500 million of the 1.5 billion total token supply for a user growth pool and development team pool. In early December 2017, the company disbursed the first round of its user growth pool grants to new users on a first-come first-served basis. \n\nBrave Growth\nSince April 2019, Brave users can opt in to Brave Rewards, which sends BAT micropayments to websites and content creators. Users receive 70% of the ad revenue share as a reward for their attention, which they can auto-contribute to publishers under default settings. Brave can automatically distribute users' contributions based on how much time they spend on sites, or distribute users' contributions according to their choosing.\n\nIn November 2019 Brave launched Brave 1.0, offering Brave Rewards to fund the open web, Brave Ads to compensate users for their attention, and Brave Shields to block ads and trackers. According to a Brave blog post, as of December 2019 Brave hosts more than 10 million monthly active users. According to BATGrowth.com as of February 2020 over 420,000 publishers were registered on Brave.","issuing_organizations":[{"slug":"brave","name":"Brave","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1558569600%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DaRvwdRDhHMFnpiJe_u28fNiex65E6a_xl9MzZW1maPg","description":"A privacy-oriented software company building a browser combined with its blockchain-based digital advertising platform to remake the web for users, publishers and advertisers"}]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Roadmap","date":null,"type":null,"details":"https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/wiki/Roadmap"}],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[{"slug":"brian-bondy","first_name":"Brian","last_name":"Bondy","title":"Founder \u0026 CTO of Brave","description":"Co-founder \u0026 CTO @brave and $BAT.

Users earn BAT for opting into Brave Ads. \n\nIn an effort to preserve privacy, the Brave browser uses local, on-device machine learning algorithms to match ads to the user's interests. When a match is made, the Brave browser delivers targeted ads to users either as system notifications or advertisements on publisher's sites. Users receive 70% of the BAT rewards for user ads, which appear as system notifications, and 15% for Publisher-Integrated Ads, which appear with publisher content.\n\nThe Brave browser is an open-source, privacy-focused, web browser that blocks third-party ads, trackers and mining scripts by default, and offers privacy features such as Tor-browsing. The Brave browser integrates the BAT platform through a feature called Brave Rewards, which includes Brave Ads, Tipping and Auto-Contribute.

ICON intents this controlled distribution strategy to incentivize greater contribution from ICON users.","general_emission_type":"Inflationary","precise_emission_type":"Dynamic Emission","is_capped_supply":false,"max_supply":null},"consensus":{"consensus_details":null,"general_consensus_mechanism":"Other","precise_consensus_mechanism":null,"targeted_block_time":1,"block_reward":null,"mining_algorithm":"n/a","next_halving_date":null,"is_victim_of_51_percent_attack":false}},"native_treasury":{"accounts":[],"treasury_usage_details":null}},"technology":{"overview":{"technology_details":"The \"network of blockchains\" that ICON aims to achieve is accomplished through Nexus, a loopchain-based blockchain that allows discrete blockchain protocols to connect in cross-chain transactions via ICON Portals that connect through Nexus.

Based on loopchain, ICON sports Loop Fault Tolerance (LFT) that aims to ensure faster network consensus without the possibility of forks by maintaining a group of trusted ICON nodes.\n\nICON tokens (ICX) are native to Nexus and transferrable between blockchains connected to the BTP network.

In 2017, Waves started a collaboration with Microsoft Azure and became an official partner of Deloitte. It also implemented a new consensus protocol, Waves-NG, based on Cornell professor Emin Gün Sirer’s Bitcoin-NG proposal, towards the end of the year. Waves-NG increased transaction throughput up to 100 tx/second. In 2018, the company released a new mobile application, which made most of Waves' most popular features available for smartphone and tablet users.\n\nToday, the platform offers purpose-designed tools to facilitate the process of developing and running dApps, and hosts various applications and use cases – from a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-exchanges\"\u003edecentralized exchange (DEX\u003c/a\u003e) and algorithmic \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/stablecoins\"\u003establecoins\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/dao\"\u003eDAOs\u003c/a\u003e, encrypted messaging, and gaming.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Smart Assets and Smart Account Trading","date":"2018-12-13T05:00:00Z","type":"Network Change","details":"Waves released Node v0.15.3 introducing the Smart Assets and Smart Account Trading features onto mainnet.

It is an open Leased-Proof-of-Stake (LPoS) blockchain, in which participants can act as forgers (validators) if they hold a certain amount of tokens or lease their tokens to validators. The consensus mechanism also features a community-driven monetary policy, with block rewards decided by forgers and an activation protocol to vote on new features being launched onto the network.\n\nThe Waves-NG protocol, adapted from Emin Gün Sirer’s Bitcoin-NG proposal, was implemented on mainnet in 2017 to enhance transaction throughput and reduce latencies. Unlike Ethereum (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\"\u003e$ETH\u003c/a\u003e), Waves transactions have fixed fees and no variable gas-like requirements.\n\nRide, Waves’ smart contract programming language, was inspired by Scala and created specifically for dApp development. Ride is a non-Turing complete and human-readable language equipped with Formal Verification and designed to make the process of learning and development faster. The incorporation of Formal Verification is meant to protect developers from various common mistakes which can lead to unintended consequences in \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/smart-contracts\"\u003esmart contracts\u003c/a\u003e and potential loss of funds. Ride is suitable for building \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/dao\"\u003eDAOs\u003c/a\u003e, Escrow facilities, Referral and Loyalty systems, Marketplaces, Digital Securities, P2P-lending, Gaming, Identity, and many other applications.\n\nThe available developer tools include Waves IDE for sandbox development, the Visual Studio code plugin for advanced users, an Oracle protocol, and tools to connect \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\"\u003edApps\u003c/a\u003e to data sources. Waves also offers a native desktop and mobile Client for accessing certain platform features, including token creation and operations, sending and exchanging tokens, and leasing WAVES. Waves Keeper, a browser plug-in similar to Ethereum’s \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/metamask\"\u003eMetaMask\u003c/a\u003e, allows users to interact with Waves-enabled websites and dApps.\n\nThe platform provided a decentralized exchange, known as Waves DEX, for crypto-to-crypto and crypto-to-fiat trading. But continuous delays and issues related to tech support led the Waves team to spin Waves DEX into Waves Exchange. The new exchange will employ a hybrid approach, keeping the features of Waves DEX considered essential like non-custodial asset storage while introducing centralized tools to improve user experience.","client_repositories":[{"name":"Waves (Scala)","link":"https://github.com/wavesplatform/Waves","license_type":"MIT"},{"name":"Waves (Go)","link":"https://github.com/wavesplatform/gowaves","license_type":"MIT"}]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"Waves Platform Security Audit","date":null,"type":null,"details":"[https://cybermashup.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/waves-audit.pdf](https://cybermashup.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/waves-audit.pdf)"}],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":"Waves governance operates similarly to other open-source networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum in that any participant can submit upgrade proposals, called Waves Enhancement Proposals (WEP).

Protocol changes do not activate once merged, however, as at least 80% of network miners must first accept the changes and download the new code to initiate the update.

Traditional exchanges require there to be a willing buyer and seller for each token pair to trade, also called liquidity. However, for many long-tail cryptoassets there is insufficient liquidity and only a few pairs to trade between. Bancor was created as an alternative model, acting as an automated market maker designed to allow constant liquidity for any token. The Bancor protocol is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and facilitates token issuance and offers an open marketplace for crypto assets. Tokens trade on-chain and can be made directly from any Ethereum wallet with fees limited to the gas needed to process the transaction. There are no counterparties in these transactions as the price is automatically calculated based on reserves in the system. The team raised $153 million in a token sale, which at the time waas the largest to date.\n\nIn July 2018, a wallet used to upgrade certain smart contracts was compromised that allowed an attacker to steal $12.5 million ETH, $10 million BNT and $1 million NPXS. The team was able to freeze the BNT, but was unable to for the other tokens. They also took the exchane offline while they conducted an investigation \n\nIn September 2019, Bancor announced they would be airdropping the entire Ethereum reserve to BNT holders. Along with this they altered the token model to create an inflationary model to reward liquidity pools, oracles and developers as determined by the community","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[{"slug":"bprotocol-foundation","name":"Bprotocol Foundation","logo":null,"description":null}]},"advisors":{"individuals":[{"slug":"john-henry-clippinger","first_name":"John ","last_name":"Henry Clippinger\t","title":"Project Advisor","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1551916800%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3Da3InlWJCkHBNVui1ni-6kY1vckYvL0MXvQgLK_zqB1U"},{"slug":"brock-pierce","first_name":"Brock","last_name":"Pierce","title":"Managing Partner of Blockchain Capital","description":"Founder and Managing Partner of Blockchain Capital.

Smart Tokens are ERC-20 compliant with additional logic to allow users to buy and sell them directly by depositing or withdrawing the connected token. The price at which they are exchanged is determined based on a fixed ratio between the value of the Smart Token and the value of the connector balance.  This ratio, known as the weight, is set by the creator of the Smart Token. The weight affects the price elasticity between the tokens and a higher weight leads to less volatility and vice versa. A weight of 100% represents a stable peg to the connected token as the price does not change. \n\nOne implementation of a Smart Token is a “relay” which has two connected tokens each with a weight of 50%. Anytime a trade occurs that shifts the supply of the connected token, the prices adjust to re-balance. \n\nThis system ensures constant liquidity making it useful for low-volume tokens that might otherwise have difficulty finding a bid/ask in a traditional order-book exchange. It also allows slippage to be calculated prior to submitting a trade since the liquidity depth is known. \"\t\t\t\t\t\t","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"Crowdsale Audit","date":null,"type":null,"details":"Crowdsale contracts were [audited ](https://gist.github.com/holiman/a5e8690cd1dcc875b9f4f39297d587be)by Martin Holst Swende on behalf of Dyno Security AB"},{"title":"Crowdsale Audit - Follow Up","date":null,"type":null,"details":"A [follow-up audit](https://gist.github.com/holiman/6d00cddec7aac98a095b9ff22838c40d) of the Crowdsale contracts was done by Martin Holst Swende on behalf of Dyno Security AB\n"},{"title":"Bancor Audit ","date":null,"type":null,"details":"Bancor protocol contracts were [audited ](https://gist.github.com/holiman/d74592af15682f03bce41aad10011a13)by Martin Holst Swende on behalf of Dyno Security AB\n"},{"title":"Bancor Audit 2","date":"2017-05-26T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Nick Johnson performed an [audit](https://gist.github.com/Arachnid/c65fd1bd61a8e0294aef95a4808edc78) of the Bancor smart contracts\n"}],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":"BNT holders vote on the inflation rate as well as the recipients of the rewards.

Decentralized exchanges have the potential to offer advantages over centralized systems such as real-time settlement, reduced counterparty risk, censorship-resistant transactions, and transparent technology. Initially, the project will focus on the exchange of ERC20 with plans to build capabilities to allow for the exchange of any Ethereum based asset.\n\n0x is not managing a decentralized exchange itself but is instead building the infrastructure to enable the creation of these platforms. Rather than using on-chain order books, 0x relies on “relayers” to manage order books through off-chain messaging, while transactions are settled on the blockchain based on quotes from the off-chain messaging service. Comparatively, this reduces costs related to updating orders and offers a faster exchange process.\n\nThe team has also created a variety of products using 0x.

Market makers can send messages off-chain that include the details around their order such as what tokens are being traded, the price, and expiration date of the order.

The registry serves as the official on-chain reference for settlement of transactions used by market participants to confirm the token addresses and exchange rates trades will settle at once executed. The suite of smart contracts accepts signed messages from takers and executes the trade on-chain. The smart contracts also provide the logic to upgrade the protocol over time.\n\nThird-party relayers build the actual exchange on top of 0x and are responsible for maintaining the order-books that host the signed messages. For providing this service, relayers set a fee-schedule similar to a centralized exchange. The main difference is relayers do not take custody of the user’s assets since trades occur on-chain.\n\nBecause the relayer system resides outside of Ethereum’s main chain one of the primary concerns the team is looking to proactively address is the potential for \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/front-running\"\u003efront-running\u003c/a\u003e.

traversable, three-dimensional (3D), virtual reality platform being built on the Ethereum blockchain. The platform focuses on the ownership of parcels of digital land where users can create unique environments in a virtual world. Content creators will be able to prove ownership of, and capture value from, their contributions to the platform. Users will be able to traverse unique areas of content, which can be clustered into districts, giving content creators targeted traffic and allow for spatial discovery of new content by users.\n\nCurrently, users gather, interact, share content, and play games primarily on large proprietary platforms like Facebook. The team believes that a decentralized model will allow participants to realize several benefits over current centralized services. Users and contributors will be able to benefit from transactions that occur on the platform, instead of allowing some or all of the revenue to flow to a single party. Furthermore, a decentralized platform will reduce the risk of censorship and vulnerabilities due to infrastructure failures or security breaches.\n\nDecentraland uses two tokens, LAND and MANA, which allow users to interact with the platform. Individual ownership of land parcels are represented by non-fungible LAND tokens containing the coordinates of a single point on the grid and a reference to the details of each parcel. Ownership details are managed through a ledger on a smart contract. To acquire LAND users must burn ERC20 based MANA tokens. MANA tokens are also used for the purchase of in-game goods and services.\n\nIn Dec. 2017, the first LAND tokens representing parcels in the first part of the game, Genesis City, were auctioned off. In March 2018, the Decentraland Marketplace was released allowing users to buy and sell parcels (LAND) in Genesis City as well as explore the area on a map. As of May 2018, the platform was still under development. The team plans to roll out access to the Decentraland world through a variety of devices including mobile, web and virtual reality (VR) platforms.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":"The Securities Framework Asset Ratings of the Crypto Rating Council (CRC) attributed the score of 3.75 out of 5 to Decentraland and provided the below summary:\nSale of tokens or token interests prior to the existence of token utility\nDecentralized development and usage\nAbsence of investment-like language or marketing\n\nThe CRC is a member-owned and operated organization whose purpose is to assess if a crypto asset, or its development, issuance, and use have characteristics that make it more or less likely to implicate federal securities laws.

Members of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/onchain-shanghai-distributed-technologies-co-ltd\"\u003eOnchain\u003c/a\u003e, a blockchain development company based in China, contributed to much of the early network developments as well as its launch process. Onchain has since stepped back to let the Ontology Foundation, and its community of open-source developers, oversee the future direction of the protocol.\n\nThe project has ties to the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/neo\"\u003eNEO\u003c/a\u003e blockchain, also the brainchild of the Onchain team, and is part of the smart economy vision set out by NEO. NEO and Ontology are both not-for-profit public blockchains and open source projects but focus on different sectors. NEO is a more generic smart contract platform that focuses on digital assets. Ontology focuses more on digital identity and the data linked to identities (think medical records, credit scores, copyrights, etc.). The two projects complement one another by facilitating positive interaction between their respective networks, as evidenced by Ontology's Open Cross-Chain Platform and other shared ecosystem projects.\n\nOntology is a high-performance public blockchain and distributed collaboration platform. It aims to provide customizable public blockchain services, with support for multiple-layers, sharding (for scalability), multiple Virtual Machines, and privacy. It also enables cross-chain communication. What it means is that Ontology can launch applications on the mainchain (such as NFT's or utility tokens) as well as set up side chains for private blockchain use cases (such supply chain, healthcare consortiums, etc.) while still linking them back to the mainchain.\n\nOntology identified several use cases for its network early on, including patient history in healthcare, distributed equity management, content generation, reputation systems, and financial services. The team also explored other sectors, such as gaming, DeFi, and the attention economy (content, short videos, and advertising trade). As of late, Ontology has turned its focus onto providing self-sovereign digital identity solutions (through its ONT ID application) and private data management, particularly within the Japanese, Korean, U.S., and European markets.\n\nAs an example, Ontology partnered with the South Korean-based Klaytn project, the public chain of Kakao. Ontology will have more technology, product integration, and interactions with Klaytn, including data privacy and the ONT ID application so that more Korean users can join the Ontology ecosystem, and more projects and enterprises can access the available markets.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Introduced VBFT Consensus Mechanism","date":"2018-04-20T04:00:00Z","type":"Project Operations","details":"VBFT is a new consensus algorithm that combines a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/proof-of-stake\"Proof-of-Stake (PoS)/a, VRF (Verifiable Random Function), and a href=\"https://messari.io/resource/byzantine-general-s-problem\"Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)/a.

These contributions include commitments of ONT into the system reserved pool, which helps secure the network (i.e., a particular stake of ONT would be required to be placed for the running of nodes, facilitating consensus execution, transaction verification, etc.). \n\nONG (Ontology Gas) is Ontology’s second utility token. The operation of Ontology requires support from various types of nodes to provide network security and stability. Network nodes receive ONG payments for any operational costs to incentivize operator participation. These payments originate from Ontology users, who pay ONG to Ontology network nodes to request Ontology services. The services that network nodes provide include transactions, network storage, deployment and execution of smart contracts, and use of other resources in Ontology. ONT holders requesting Ontology network nodes periodically pay ONG in operation costs to maintain the ongoing operation of the network.\n\nUnlike most other cryptoassets, ONT is indivisible; users can only acquire ONT tokens in whole units. Its counterpart, ONG, is divisible up to nine decimal points \n\nOntology tried to create a positive feedback loop by utilizing a dual-token design. This design uses ONT for staking and ONG as gas. Within the staking design, network nodes deposit ONT on the network to act as a financial burden incentivizing unselfish behavior. These same stakers receive ONG as revenue for deploying their resources and enduring operating costs to help secure the network. Ontology's system also uses ONG in a utility token role as it acts as a value anchoring tool for on-chain applications.\n\nLearn more:\nA Breakdown of The Ontology Dual-Token Model"},"launch":{"general":{"launch_style":"Centralized Distribution","launch_details":"Ontology did not pursue an ICO to fund its development.

In principle, the nodes whose total pledge is twice the average pledge of all consensus nodes will receive the highest fee distribution income. If the quantity is more, the revenue will decrease. The allocation of candidate nodes is based on the proportion of the node's total pledge in comparison with all candidate nodes.\n\n__Foundation incentives__\nIn order to encourage node participation, the Ontology Foundation will award 1% (10 million ONG) of the total ONG to the eligible nodes each year for three consecutive years (starting from 2018, please refer to the supplementary explanation). The allocation of this part is assigned according to the following rules: \n- Distribution cycle: The monthly share of each month at the beginning of each natural month \n- Distribution rules: The total amount of foundation incentives per month is 833333.3333 ONG (10 million halve to each month)\n\nThe dApps running on Ontology currently can be selected to be bound to a certain node. After binding, the node will receive an equal bonus of 30% of the dApps's monthly handling fee. All the rewards obtained after the dApp is bound will be from the monthly total. After deduction, the upper limit is 30%. The remainder of the monthly total will be evenly distributed to the top 49 nodes.\n\n__Examples__\n- Example 1:  Assume that there are currently 49 nodes, of which only node A is bound to a dApp, and the dApp generates a commission of 10,000 ONG this month. The node can receive 30% ONG, which is a reward of 3,000 ONG. This part of the reward is deducted from the total monthly incentives. The remaining 830333.33 ONG is divided equally among the top 49 nodes, each node is divided into 16945.5782 ONG. Therefore, a node can receive a total of 19945.5782ONG (3000+16945.5782).\n- Example 2:  Assume that there are currently 49 nodes, of which only node A is bound to a dApp, and the dApp generated a handling fee of 1,000,000 ONG this month. Since 30% of the handling fee has exceeded 30% of the total monthly incentives, they can only receive 249,999.99 ONG bound dApp rewards, which is deducted from the total monthly incentives, leaving 583,333.3334 ONG equally divided to the top 49 Named nodes, each node is divided into 11904.7619ONG. A node can receive a total of 261904.7618ONG (249999.9999+11904.7619)\n\nSupplementary Information Conditions for obtaining foundation rewards:\n- The node is in the pledge state for the entire month\n- The node was ranked in the top 49 for the natural month -- *For example, if a total of 5 cycles occur in a certain month, and a node ranks in the top 49 at the beginning of 3 of the cycles, the node can obtain 3/5ths of a node reward.* \n\n__Definitions:__ \n- All cycles in the natural month:  All cycles beginning in the month are counted as cycles experienced during the month.\n- Ranked

scaling protocol for Ethereum","category":"Infrastructure","sector":"Scaling","tags":null,"project_details":"OMG Network is a Layer-2 scaling protocol for Ethereum. What this protocol aims to achieve is a higher transaction throughput at a lower cost while leveraging the security guarantees of its underlying layer. OMG Network is predicated on the creation of a child chain that batches transactions before committing them to the root chain, which, in this case, is Ethereum. The child chain relies on the root chain as the trust and arbitration layer.  With this type of relationship, if something goes wrong with the child chain, users’ funds should remain safe. The protocol's token, OMG, is the primary method by which users can pay for transaction fees and interact with the network.","official_links":[{"name":"Whitepaper","link":"https://omisego.cdn.prismic.io/omisego%2F0ee9c68a-7455-4495-8696-86f9934b972a_whitepaper.pdf"},{"name":"Website","link":"https://omisego.co"},{"name":"Github","link":"https://github.com/omisego"},{"name":"Twitter","link":"https://twitter.com/omise_go"},{"name":"Reddit","link":"http://reddit.com/r/omise_go"},{"name":"Blog","link":"https://omisego.co/blog "},{"name":"YouTube","link":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-NfGRxTkJfVbFgyJoOxzCQ"}]},"background":{"background_details":"OMG Network (first developed as OmiseGo) is a non-custodial, Layer 2 scaling solution for transferring value on Ethereum. How the protocol processes transactions is centralized, but its Plasma-based design aims to decentralize network security. It also relies on Ethereum at its final arbitration layer. Most blockchain ecosystems are limited by low throughput, high and unpredictable transaction fees, and poor user experience. The project's team believes these are barriers that need to be overcome before businesses and developers will adopt blockchain for real-world applications, leading them to develop the OMG Network.\n\nThe core security proposition of Plasma revolves around honest users being able to exit the child chain (in other words, withdraw funds to the root chain) at any time. To exit the child chain, a user submits an exit transaction – along with an exit bond – to the root chain. The exit is subject to a \"challenge period,\" during which any user can prove, if applicable, that the exit is invalid. If successfully shown to be invalid, the exit is not processed, and the challenger is awarded the exit bond. This exit game is solely dependent on the root chain.\n\nAs the child chain relies on the root chain to be its ultimate arbiter, it must periodically commit a hashed version of its state changes to the root chain by way of a smart contract. As opposed to submitting individual transaction data onto the root chain, the child chain bundles transactions into a Merkle tree and submits the root hash. Beyond these core elements, there is no prescribed configuration for a Plasma chain. They can take on different consensus protocols, block validation mechanisms, or fraud proofs. The design is adaptable to the use case. OMG Network is based on the Plasma MoreVP design, an extension of Minimum Viable Plasma optimized for the settlement of payments and value exchange between users and exchanges.\n\nThe original OMG Network team (under the OmiseGo name) co-authored the original Plasma white paper with Joseph Poon and was also the first project to perform an airdrop, a way to more widely share ownership of our token with the existing Ethereum community.","issuing_organizations":[{"slug":"omisego","name":"OMG Network","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/Ft-lxp5T_400x400.jpg","description":"Omise, a Thailand-based payment service provider, formed the Omise Blockchain Lab in 2015 to explore how blockchain could help provide real-world payment solutions.

Loopring protocol pursues this by incentivizing ecosystem participants to perform exchange functions in a decentralized manner, with trades processed by non-custodial smart contracts. \n\nAlthough blockchains inherently provide trustless trading, there are problems with building exchanges purely on-chain. Specifically, processing speed, throughput, and computation costs. Performing all exchange steps on-chain can be prohibitively expensive, or impossible to emulate centralized exchange speed and performance. For these reasons, Loopring has moved almost all data and computation off-chain but leverages \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/zero-knowledge-proofs\"\u003ezero-knowledge proofs\u003c/a\u003e to retain trust-minimized properties. \n\nLoopring originally planned to be blockchain agnostic and to operate on all feasible large public blockchains with smart contract capability. Loopring was first deployed on \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e to trade ERC20 tokens and uses its LRC token to operate. It has deployed on top of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/neo\"\u003eNEO\u003c/a\u003e \n and airdropped a native LRN, however, that effort is paused. There were plans for a similar launch on top of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/qtum\"\u003eQTUM\u003c/a\u003e with an LRQ token but that was scrapped entirely.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Loopring v1 release","date":"2017-12-13T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":null},{"title":"First LRN airdrop","date":"2018-07-02T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"LRC holders received LRN, airdropped version of the Loopring token on NEO "},{"title":"Second LRN airdrop","date":"2018-09-05T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"1.5 million LRN was airdropped to 758 NEO addresses bound to 892 Ethereum addresses"},{"title":"Third LRN airdrop","date":"2018-11-30T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"A total of 2.1 million LRN was airdropped to 854 NEO addresses, corresponding to 1039 Ethereum addresses."},{"title":"Loopring 2.0 released","date":"2018-12-27T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"An upgrade to the protocol was released to allow more efficient ring settlement, a new fee model, and additional ways to create orders.

Their balances are stored off-chain in Merkle trees where they are updated based on transfer requests rather than an actual exchange of assets between user wallets. The manner in which orders are matched up is up to the exchange operator but when it comes time for settlement, the protocol will create a ring settlement request by matching two orders and sending the request to the operator who in turn includes it in a block, receives a fee and commits the request on-chain. Users can also withdraw their funds at any time. If a specified amount of time passes since the withdrawal requests and the exchange still has not processed the withdrawal, the protocol will enter an irreversible withdrawal mode that shuts the exchange down enabling only withdrawal functionality. \n","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"Security Audit","date":"2019-11-20T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"SECBIT [audited](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/secbit-delivers-a-security-audit-report-for-loopring-protocol-3-0-a768c2bd061a) and analyzed the contracts of Loopring v3 and found no critical vulnerabilities.

assurances. It combines different aspects of the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains. Qtum uses Bitcoin core as the base of its network for security and stability reasons and, therefore, operates via a UTXO model. The project also integrated Ethereum's virtual machine (the EVM) so the chain could run Turing complete code needed to support smart contracts, and thus decentralized applications (dApps). Qtum's stack features a middleware layer, dubbed the account abstraction layer (AAL), to ensure the UTXO set was compatible with the smart contract execution layer. Qtum's native token (QTUM) allows users to pay transaction fees, participate in network security, and vote on protocol upgrade proposals.

Prior to founding Qtum, Patric was a member of the Alibaba team while Neil Mahi came in with 20 years of software development experience. Both founders had spent multiple years working with cryptoassets before pursuing Qtum.\n\nMarrying aspects of Bitcoin and Ethereum\nQtum aims to harness the best attributes of the \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoinhttps://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\"\u003eBitcoin\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e blockchains to create a smart contracting platform. The protocol uses the Bitcoin core code as its base for security and stability reasons. Since Bitcoin does not support Turing complete smart contracts, Qtum integrated Ethereum's virtual machine (dubbed the Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM) to make the network capable of running decentralized applications (dApps). It also has plans to integrate additional virtual machines, namely the X86 VM, to support smart contract programming languages beyond Solidity.\n\nThe combination of Bitcoin and Ethereum attributes creates a compatibility issue. Bitcoin uses a UTXO model to track coin ownership, while Ethereum (like most other protocols sporting virtual machines) employs an account-based model for simplicity. The Qtum tech stack, therefore, contains a conversion layer, called the account abstraction layer (AAL), in between Bitcoin code and the EVM to ensure UTXO and virtual machine compatibility.\n\nPoS consensus and on-chain governance\nQtum opted to use an adaptation of Blackcoin's Poof-of-Stake (PoS) model as its consensus mechanism. The team believed Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchain protocols suffered from categorical scaling limitations that PoS could help alleviate. Qtum also has an on-chain governance system (aka Decentralized Governance Protocol or DGP) to pass on decision-making responsibilities to token holders. Network parameters up for discussion include block size and base gas fee, among others. In addition to the on-chain governance system, the Qtum Foundation plays a central role in the development and promotion of the Qtum blockchain.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[{"slug":"brett-fincaryk","first_name":"Brett ","last_name":"Fincaryk","title":"Community Manager at Qtum Foundation","description":"Community Manager at Qtum Foundation","avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1547078400%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DiI19lREyxnsXyHNFqDWkaNIQZ8osWmunjBuffe9YznY"},{"slug":"miguel-palencia","first_name":"Miguel ","last_name":"Palencia","title":"Chief Information Officer at Qtum Foundation","description":"Chief Information Officer at Qtum Foundation","avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1547078400%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DAFIERHmLAS-nisauNVjQNF-9tR_190fSIbklllqbqmk"},{"slug":"weiyu-qi","first_name":"Weiyu ","last_name":"Qi","title":"Developer at Qtum","description":"Developer at Qtum","avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1547078400%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DzkGBDlfqYQdeCNVXztXhQs07mHDs2yunvnYu_IJ8ZbY"},{"slug":"yunqi-ouyang","first_name":"Yunqi ","last_name":"Ouyang","title":"Web Developer at Qtum","description":"Web Developer at Qtum","avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/3143564%3Fs%3D460%26v%3D4"},{"slug":"stella-kung","first_name":"Stella ","last_name":"Kung","title":"Head of PR and Marketing at Qtum Foundation","description":"Head of PR and Marketing at Qtum Foundation","avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/ProfilePic_400x400.jpg"},{"slug":"john-scianna","first_name":"John ","last_name":"Scianna","title":"Marketing Director at Qtum Foundation","description":"Marketing Director at Qtum Foundation","avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/RHAZyaoL_400x400.jpg"},{"slug":"david-jaenson","first_name":"David ","last_name":"Jaenson","title":"Developer at Qtum Foundation","description":"Developer at Qtum Foundation","avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1547078400%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DC9dM5MCXFdx9KnQDHYz5cGsxojafH_jF5ZKAu1bnYpo"},{"slug":"phoenix-lu","first_name":"Phoenix ","last_name":"Lu","title":"PR and Marketing Manager at Qtum Foundation","description":"PR and Marketing Manager at Qtum Foundation","avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1547078400%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DzRzj35rcyPdUqd7Jb2DUtdzHy1XXHNwuq8LkRy0EdqE"},{"slug":"jordan-earls","first_name":"Jordan ","last_name":"Earls","title":"Core Developer at Qtum Foundation","description":"Core Developer at Qtum Foundation","avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/371222%3Fs%3D460%26v%3D4"},{"slug":"huaming-he","first_name":"Huaming ","last_name":"He","title":"Developer at Qtum","description":"Developer at Qtum","avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/Bcz1N9kE_400x400.jpg"},{"slug":"baiqiang-dong","first_name":"Baiqiang ","last_name":"Dong","title":"Developer at Qtum","description":"Developer at Qtum","avatar_url":null},{"slug":"jun-chen","first_name":"Jun ","last_name":"Chen","title":"Blockchain Developer at Qtum","description":"Blockchain Developer at Qtum","avatar_url":null},{"slug":"patrick-dai","first_name":"Patrick ","last_name":"Dai                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ","title":"Co-founder of Qtum","description":"Co-founder of Qtum","avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1547078400%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DA1yJD3NjN6M2ODhZjX4N7sC878sgf7J6Whg9vbVHolo"},{"slug":"wenbin-zhong","first_name":"Wenbin ","last_name":"Zhong","title":"Blockchain Developer at Qtum","description":"Blockchain Developer at Qtum","avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1547078400%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DRNg-lYOrY8FTvMAbXaxr7rWQMYPnWsFZuIO9wO0wBcA"}],"organizations":[{"slug":"qtum-chain-foundation","name":"Qtum Chain Foundation","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/9e17rwRG_400x400.jpg","description":"The Qtum Chain Foundation is a non-profit company founded in Nov. 2016 and registered in Singapore.

The first having will occur at block 990,501. \nFor the genesis blocks 1 – 5000, the block rewards were 20,000 QTUM with no transaction fees. \nStarting at block 5,001, the block reward was 4.0 QTUM, until block 990,500. As a result, 3,942,000 new QTUM will be created during this interval.\nStarting with block 990,501, the block reward will be halved to 2.0 QTUM, and every 4 ½ years after, halved again.   \n0.4 QTUM is rewarded at the time the block is created. This amount is locked up until it is mature (500 blocks). The remaining 3.6 QTUM are added over 9 blocks after the initial 0.4 QTUM reward has matured.

In short, validators stake tokens (i.e. lock up tokens in escrow) in order to validate transactions and produce blocks. The likelihood of being chosen to produce a block is proportional to the number of tokens one has staked on the network (each new coin staked reduces the difficulty of producing the next block to a point). By design, PoS incorporates a slashing penalty (i.e., coin confiscation) to disincentivize participants form trying to game the system. Qtum opted for PoS because it believes PoW is energy-intensive, wasteful, and unsustainable. \n\nCoin maturity\nUnlike some other PoS chains, Qtum does not have a minimum staking requirements. This strategy can encourage widespread participation (thus increasing the decentralization of validators), but it means consensus participants have less of an incentive to remain honest. Qtum addresses this challenge through its coin maturity mechanism, which requires staking tokens to \"mature\" (i.e., staked for at least 500 blocks) to participate in block production and receive staking rewards.\n\nThe Qtum network produces a 2 MB block every 120 seconds (two minutes). Each block rewards the validator with a total of 4 newly minted QTUM, but these stakers only receive 0.4 QTUM once the block is created. The protocol locks the remaining 3.6 QTUM until the initial 0.4 reward has reached maturity (which, as mentioned, takes 500 blocks). After maturing, the validator receives the rest of the inflation reward in incremental payouts over nine blocks.","general_consensus_mechanism":"Proof-of-Stake","precise_consensus_mechanism":null,"targeted_block_time":120,"block_reward":4,"mining_algorithm":"n/a","next_halving_date":"2021-10-27T04:00:00Z","is_victim_of_51_percent_attack":false}},"native_treasury":{"accounts":[],"treasury_usage_details":null}},"technology":{"overview":{"technology_details":"Qtum plans to implement the first iteration of a new Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, Incentive Proof-of-Stake (IPoS), which is compatible with UTXO-based blockchains like Bitcoin.

DGP will be able to issue approved changes via a soft fork (whenever possible), thereby preventing any network disruptions often seen during hard fork upgrades. More significant upgrades that would require a hard fork to implement would instead go through Qtum's off-chain governance process.\n\nThere are four steps to the DGP process:\n\n1. A network participant or group of stakeholders creates a proposal that aims to change a specific network parameter\n2. All governance participants vote on the proposal\n3.

is a platform for decentralized cloud data storage, getting built by a team at Boston-based Nebulous Inc., founded in 2014. Sia connects people “hosts” that have underutilized hard drive capacity with customers “renters” in search of data storage. The aim is to provide a platform that allows for peer-hosted storage of files, without the need for a single centralized entity to control the data. Sia itself would store only the storage contracts formed between the parties.\n\nIn the platform, files of individual users will be broken up and spread across a number of storage providers, known as hosts. These hosts will need to provide proof of file storage on a regular basis in order to receive payment and not be penalized. Payment is in the form of Siacoin and penalties involve the host losing Siacoin collateral that was put up. The proofs provided by hosts are available on the Sia blockchain for verification by miners, who also receive payment in the form of Siacoin for their verification work.\n\nInstead of pre-mining a certain amount of Siacoin, Nebulous intends to generate revenue from fees on all contracts. This is done through the existence of so-called siafunds. When a contract is created, 3.9% of the contract fund is removed and distributed to the holders of siafunds. Nebulous Inc started off holding 88%, with the remainder held by early crowd-fund backers of Sia.. Siafunds can be transferred to other addresses but not used as payments on the platform.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":"In Oct. 2019, Sia settled with the SEC over their unregistered token sale.

If a valid proof is provided during the required window an automatic payment goes to the host. If the proof is missing or invalid the coins are sent to a “missed proof” address, likely an unspendable address.\n\nHosts will be able to advertise themselves in different ways, e.g. as highly reliable, requiring a higher price and with higher penalties for losing files, or as less reliable, with lower prices but with lower penalties for losing files. The intention is for this to result in an optimized, efficient market place.\n\nThe Sia software divides files into 30 segments before uploading, each targeted for distribution to hosts across the world. This distribution assures that no one host represents a single point of failure and reinforces overall network uptime and redundancy. File segments are created using a technology called Reed-Solomon erasure coding, commonly used in CDs and DVDs. Erasure coding allows Sia to divide files in a redundant manner, where any 10 of 30 segments can fully recover a user's files. Sia is more secure than existing solutions because hosts only store encrypted file segments, rather than whole files.

But in the same way Holochain is not a blockchain, according to the development team, Holo is also not a token.

Instead, peers simply \"gossip\" with each other about shared data, and if rules are broken, a given transaction is rejected by a validating peer. \n\nCritical to Holochain's architecture is an understanding of agent-centric design. Cryptocurrencies are, according to the team, data-centric, which is to say they are built around the concept that data is a specific object. But Holochain aims to be agent-centric which supports the idea that a network and its protocol are not an actual objective thing. Instead, Holochain says it's a variety of shared, relative experiences. \n\nHolo, on top of Holochain, aims to allow network participants to transform their computers into small sources of revenue by hosting compatible decentralized applications. Hosts set their own prices and select which dapps they want to host. Holo is an ERC-20 compliant token used to fuel peer-to-peer relationships on Holo.

The project included a sustainable funding model, and building upon zero-knowledge technologies, wanted to incentivize every stakeholder and build an ecosystem around it. Horizen launching a Secure and Super node ecosystem and giving a share of the block reward to them marked an important milestone for Horizen, paving the way for an increase in its node count.  \n\nIn 2018, Horizen experienced an attempted 51% attack. In response, the team amended Horizen's consensus mechanism and introduced a penalty for delayed block reporting, which makes it exponentially more difficult and costly for those looking to perform a 51% attack. The solution is being used by other projects, such as Pirl.   \n\nThe project underwent a brand expansion in August 2018 and emerged under their new name, Horizen. This marked project's evolution from a cryptocurrency to a privacy platform with a focus on scalability.  Horizen’s scaling solution, Zendoo, is an attempt to create a completely decentralized and fully customizable interoperable protocol. The Horizen interoperable blockchain platform was created to enable businesses and developers to affordably and quickly create their own public or private blockchains and decentralized applications on Horizen’s fully distributed, secure, and privacy-preserving architecture. Horizen’s sidechain SDK provides the components needed to build a completely decentralized and fully customizable blockchain or decentralized application on a blockchain.  \n\nZEN, the native currency of Horizen, is a mineable PoW coin available on major crypto exchanges. Users can securely store and transact ZEN using Horizen's app, Sphere by Horizen, a multifunctional wallet that interfaces with Horizen products and services.  \n\nHorizen has a network of more than 40,000 incentivized Secure and Super Nodes, making it one of the largest public node networks in the industry.\n","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Launch (As ZenCash)","date":"2017-06-30T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Listed on Bittrex exchange; Full client wallet"},{"title":"Expanded Privacy Features","date":"2017-09-30T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"ZenChat Messenger; TLS/SSL Certificate; Tor nodes; Wallets: mobile, web, paper, third-party"},{"title":"Secure Nodes Go Live","date":"2017-12-31T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"First secure \u0026 private node system; Block rewards for node operators; Arizen lite wallet release; Interim proposal \u0026 voting system"},{"title":"IOHK R\u0026D partnership","date":"2018-03-31T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Team expansion; New website launched + soft rebrand; 20+ partnerships \u0026 integrations along the way!"},{"title":"Transition from currency to platform","date":"2018-06-30T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Ledger hardware wallet integration; DAO prototype; Major blockchain updates"},{"title":"Super Nodes and Brand Expansion","date":"2018-09-30T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Expanded our brand to Horizen; Prevention of 51% attack research and development; Innovation: Enhanced the Nakamoto Consensus; Blockchain improvements; DAG scaling prototype; Design sidechain model; 30+ partnerships \u0026 integration"},{"title":"Super Nodes Go Live","date":"2018-12-31T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Release flagship app (Radical Usability); Begin SDK design for sidechains; Begin Sidechains prototype; Public Accounting System (Radical Transparency)"},{"title":"Blockchain Improvements","date":"2019-03-31T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Core software upgrade ZEN 2.0.16 - successful hard fork, Sprout zk-SNARKS circuit, increased robustness and speed, zk-SNARKS upstream vulnerability fix; Node tracker upgrades 0.4.0; Sphere by Horizen upgrades 1.1.0b; Sidechain development begins - Research and Proof of Concept, Framework selection; Horizen Academy launch"},{"title":"Blockchain Improvements","date":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Core software upgrade ZEN 2.0.17; Moves to public repository; Two Sphere by Horizen upgrades; Sidechain development progresses; SDK Alpha development began; Consensus selection: Ouroboros Praos; Merchant directory release"},{"title":"Platform (Sidechain nodes live on testnet)","date":"2019-09-30T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Core software upgrade ZEN 2.0.18; Sphere by Horizen upgrades 1.2.0b; ZEN Faucet upgrades; Horizen Developer Environment (HDE) development begins; Multiple sidechain nodes live on testnet"},{"title":"Sidechain Alpha","date":"2019-12-31T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Core software upgrade ZEN 2.0.19; Sphere by Horizen upgrades 1.2.2b; Sidechain development - Sidechain Alpha; Begins development for Beta; Mainchain implementation of sidechain support; ZEN Faucet improvements"},{"title":"Sidechain Beta 1Q","date":"2020-03-31T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Sidechain Beta 1Q - parallel testnet; Kick-off Voting using ID study Q1-4Q (UNC); Sphere Desktop issues; Sphere Desktop modifications for sidechains; Node tracker improvements; ZEND deprecation (bug fixes only); ZEND code audit (third-party); HDE beta public testing; Academy Lite on Medium; Publish Academy Expert content"},{"title":"Sidechain Beta 2.0","date":"2020-06-30T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Sidechain Beta 2.0; Extended Model Mainchain support - parallel testnet; Block explorer upgrade; ZEND deprecation (bug fixes only); ZEND code audit (Sapling / Sprout Groth16); Academy ebook; Node Tracker improvements"},{"title":"Sidechain Beta 2.0","date":"2020-09-30T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Sidechain Beta 2.0 move to official testnet; Sidechain Beta 2.0 code fixes; Academy rewards; HDE Team Requests; Node Tracker improvements"},{"title":"Sidechain SDK","date":"2020-12-31T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"SDK add extended model 4Q in Testnet; SDK + extended model audit; Publish Voting using ID study (UNC); Academy social badges; HDE Leaderboard; HDE Proposal system; Node Tracker improvements"}],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":"The Securities Framework Asset Ratings of the Crypto Rating Council (CRC) attributed the score of 1 out of 5 to Horizen and provided the below summary:\nDesigned to function as a cryptocurrency for transactions settlement with enhanced privacy features\nUses the Equihash Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining algorithm\nFormerly known as ZenCash, Horizen is a fork of ZClassic, which itself is a fork of Zcash.

Originally, Horizen's block rewards yielded 3.5% to the full node operators, given that they meet certain requirements. Horizen changed their model in July of 2018 by introducing a new node class and shifting the block rewards distribution to give both secure and super node operators 10% of the total block rewards. Miners who were originally rewarded 88% of each block reward received 70%, while the remaining 10% went to the Treasury, a 1.5% increase from the original model.\n\nDue to lack of enough funding for ongoing development as a result of 2018 bear market, the team proposed to increase the Treasury pool to 20% of block rewards while reducing the mining reward pool from 70% to 60% which has been implemented as a result of a successfully hard fork at the block height #455555.\n\nTherefore, the current block rewards split between each of the four groups is: \n\nSecure nodes – 10%\nSuper nodes – 10%\nMiners – 60%\nTreasury – 20%\n\nThe founders and directors of the Zen Blockchain Foundation are responsible for managing the funds of the Horizen Treasury, until at such point that the community is able to govern the treasury. The Horizen treasury model is designed to eventually become a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) and claims that it will be provably fair, transparent, and provide economic incentives for participation. \n\n","general_emission_type":"Inflationary","precise_emission_type":"Decreasing Issuance","is_capped_supply":true,"max_supply":21000000},"consensus":{"consensus_details":"Horizen uses an ammended version of Nakamoto Consensus whereby the valid chain is the longest chain with the most accumulated proof-of-work.

A network of mining and economic nodes maintains this blockchain by validating, propagating, and competing to include pending transactions (mempool) in new blocks. Economic nodes (aka \"full nodes\") receive transactions from other network participants, validate them against network consensus rules and double-spend vectors, and propagate the transactions to other full nodes that also validate and propagate. Valid transactions are sent to the network's mempool waiting for mining nodes to confirm them via inclusion in the next block.  \n\nMining nodes work to empty the mempool usually in a highest-to-lowest fee order by picking transactions to include in the next block and racing against each other to generate a hash less than the target number set by Horizen's difficulty adjustment algorithm. Horizen uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to establish the chain of blocks with the most accumulated \"work\" (a.k.a., energy spent on solved hashes) as the valid chain. Other network peers can cheaply verify the chain’s work.  \n\nIn order to have zero-knowledge privacy in Horizen, the function determining the validity of a transaction according to the network’s consensus rules must return the answer of whether the transaction is valid or not, without revealing any of the information it performed the calculations on. This is done by encoding some of the network’s consensus rules in zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge). Zk-SNARKs are specific zero-knowledge proofs whereby one can prove possession of certain information, e.g. a secret key, without revealing that information, and without any interaction between the prover and verifier.   \n\nHorizen addresses are either private (z-addresses) or transparent (t-addresses). Z-addresses start with a “zc,” and t-addresses start with a \"zn.\" The two Horizen address types are interoperable, and funds can be transferred between z-addresses and t-addresses. A Z-to-Z transaction appears on the public blockchain, so it is known to have occurred and that the fees were paid. But the addresses, transaction amount, and the memo field are all encrypted and not publicly visible. Transactions between two transparent addresses (t-addresses) work just like Bitcoin: The sender, receiver, and transaction value are publicly visible. The owner of an address may choose to disclose z-address and transaction details with trusted third parties using view keys and payment disclosure.","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"Mainchain Audit","date":null,"type":null,"details":"Coinspect identified 1 high, 4 medium, and 2 low risk vulnerabilities.

Historically most protocol development is largely handled by Zen Blockchain Foundation, a founding non-profit organization. Zen Blockchain Foundation (ZBF) maintains \"zend,\" the only production-ready node implementation.   \n\nZBF contracts Horizen Labs for development work and consulting. Horizen Labs is a for-profit company mainly focusing on ZK circuit construction and business support for Horizen's sidechain implementation - Zendoo.   Protocol development is governed by the Horizen Improvement Proposal process (ZenIP) whereby anyone in the open source Horizen community can submit draft ZenIPs. After discussion by the Horizen community, the ZenIP editors, features are selected for the upcoming network upgrade. There are three organizations, Horizen Community Council, Zen Blockchain Foundation, and Horizen Labs Company each have one editor elected for the process. ZenIP Editors will have to make decisions and unanimity cannot be assumed and is not necessary for all kinds of decisions. Majority decision means more than half (  50%) of the Editors need to agree. Supermajority decision means more than two thirds (  66.6%) need to agree. Additionally, there are decisions that require unanimity. Decisions from the ZenIP process are written into the Horizen specification, as well as the software that runs the network. Protocol changes are \"ratified\" on-chain when the majority of the network adopts the upgrade and doesn’t break consensus.  \n\nThe Zen Blockchain Foundation receives an allocation of the treasury reward every block, which consists of 20% from the block reward. Moving forward Zen Blockchain Foundation plans to further decentralize the Horizen project through building a treasury sidechain governance system, increasing community involvement, and ultimately reducing the influence of itself on the Horizen protocol. Meaningful steps to this end include the creation of Horizen Community Council, a community organization having a representative in ZenIP process, and actively supporting the community and being their voice.","onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":"Upcoming","onchain_governance_details":null,"is_treasury_decentralized":false},"grants":[]},"metadata":{"updated_at":"2021-02-18T17:35:12Z"}}},{"id":"0bb97d30-b5bb-45d6-b105-e49436cace0e","symbol":"GNT","name":"Golem","slug":"golem","_internal_temp_agora_id":"81cb9d96-acd5-4272-b30c-e895da544a66","metrics":{"market_data":{"price_usd":0.46426836743604716,"price_btc":0.00000810033213601358,"price_eth":0.00026242491687186416,"volume_last_24_hours":51239391.7193086,"real_volume_last_24_hours":3204056.5178324627,"volume_last_24_hours_overstatement_multiple":15.992037416984124,"percent_change_usd_last_1_hour":-0.21720645581020667,"percent_change_usd_last_24_hours":5.100918584783573,"percent_change_btc_last_24_hours":4.267211028789694,"percent_change_eth_last_24_hours":6.60701013657965,"ohlcv_last_1_hour":{"open":0.46210202720891524,"high":0.47004664441967214,"low":0.46095475670379676,"close":0.46759797249971,"volume":47729.37849799665},"ohlcv_last_24_hour":{"open":0.4370341241703235,"high":0.501767864360567,"low":0.4370341241703235,"close":0.46426836743604716,"volume":3163257.1156885545},"last_trade_at":"2021-03-12T19:12:49.99Z"},"marketcap":{"marketcap_dominance_percent":0.026676972013421868,"current_marketcap_usd":464334083.73263264,"y_2050_marketcap_usd":464334088.1334647,"y_plus10_marketcap_usd":464334088.1334647,"liquid_marketcap_usd":464334088.1334647,"realized_marketcap_usd":91406045.01779006,"volume_turnover_last_24_hours_percent":0.6900721863587124},"supply":{"y_2050":1000000000,"y_plus10":1000000000,"liquid":1000000000,"circulating":999999990.5222722,"y_2050_issued_percent":100,"annual_inflation_percent":0,"stock_to_flow":null,"y_plus10_issued_percent":100},"blockchain_stats_24_hours":{"count_of_active_addresses":240,"transaction_volume":723839.2826317494,"adjusted_transaction_volume":400683.4075271274,"adjusted_nvt":602.941619265919,"median_tx_value":247.82331538563926,"median_tx_fee":null,"count_of_tx":207,"count_of_payments":205,"new_issuance":null,"average_difficulty":null,"kilobytes_added":null,"count_of_blocks_added":null},"market_data_liquidity":{"clearing_prices_to_sell":null,"marketcap":null,"asset_bid_depth":null,"usd_bid_depth":null,"updated_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"},"all_time_high":{"price":1.2016030119205907,"at":"2018-01-08T07:00:00Z","days_since":1159,"percent_down":61.27849734786014,"breakeven_multiple":2.582544404290408},"cycle_low":{"price":0.022620922240946813,"at":"2020-03-13T02:00:00Z","percent_up":1944.9210101499123,"days_since":364},"token_sale_stats":{"sale_proceeds_usd":8596000,"sale_start_date":"2016-11-11","sale_end_date":"2016-11-13","roi_since_sale_usd_percent":3535.708715452585,"roi_since_sale_btc_percent":-67.56307024036776,"roi_since_sale_eth_percent":null},"staking_stats":{"staking_yield_percent":null,"staking_type":null,"staking_minimum":null,"tokens_staked":null,"tokens_staked_percent":null,"real_staking_yield_percent":null},"mining_stats":{"mining_algo":null,"network_hash_rate":null,"available_on_nicehash_percent":null,"1_hour_attack_cost":null,"24_hours_attack_cost":null,"attack_appeal":null,"mining_revenue_native":null,"mining_revenue_usd":null,"average_difficulty":null},"developer_activity":{"stars":0,"watchers":3,"commits_last_3_months":1,"commits_last_1_year":36,"lines_added_last_3_months":0,"lines_added_last_1_year":1117,"lines_deleted_last_3_months":0,"lines_deleted_last_1_year":450},"roi_data":{"percent_change_last_1_week":11.964734174038329,"percent_change_last_1_month":77.9687597479863,"percent_change_last_3_months":289.0693103618612,"percent_change_last_1_year":1791.3422410027706,"percent_change_btc_last_1_week":-4.823216931143704,"percent_change_btc_last_1_month":39.03399721401082,"percent_change_btc_last_3_months":27.553751847190235,"percent_change_btc_last_1_year":58.278618158238146,"percent_change_eth_last_1_week":-3.74103960311154,"percent_change_eth_last_1_month":74.30317025984397,"percent_change_eth_last_3_months":24.295086121034412,"percent_change_eth_last_1_year":14.891386521239887,"percent_change_month_to_date":34.431473896529305,"percent_change_quarter_to_date":286.1359530175098,"percent_change_year_to_date":286.1359530175098},"roi_by_year":{"2020_usd_percent":320.8274076622725,"2019_usd_percent":-57.407486428500775,"2018_usd_percent":-92.98965542670452,"2017_usd_percent":231.25192596160704,"2016_usd_percent":0,"2015_usd_percent":0,"2014_usd_percent":0,"2013_usd_percent":0,"2012_usd_percent":0,"2011_usd_percent":0},"risk_metrics":{"sharpe_ratios":{"last_30_days":5.991734733865422,"last_90_days":4.717261513763875,"last_1_year":2.8837386112555605,"last_3_years":0.7627855128924371},"volatility_stats":{"volatility_last_30_days":2.772324052408303,"volatility_last_90_days":2.0793549737323267,"volatility_last_1_year":1.5848893690574215,"volatility_last_3_years":1.3749005860604453}},"misc_data":{"private_market_price_usd":null,"vladimir_club_cost":36357.087154525856,"btc_current_normalized_supply

is a DApp on the Ethereum blockchain. Golem is a global, open-source, decentralized supercomputer that allows anyone to share and aggregate computing resources to create a global supercomputer. It is made up of the combined power of users’ machines, from PC’s to entire data centers. Golem creates a decentralized sharing economy of computing power and supplies software developers with a cheap source of computing power. The team is focused on tasks that require a large amount of resources such as computer-generated imagery (CGI), machine learning, and scientific computing. By creating a network to share resources Golem hopes to supply software developers with an alternative to traditional centralized cloud service providers like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and IBM. \n\nThe network functions as a peer-to-peer marketplace for excess computing power. Users can rent out their hardware in exchange for compensation in Golem tokens (GNT). Those that require resources to complete intensive tasks, like CGI rendering, can pay for this excess capacity through a decentralized marketplace. The team plans to integrate an application registry that will allow developers to create applications on top of Golem.\n\nGolem Factory was founded in Switzerland in 2016 by Julian Zawistowski and Andrzej Regulski. Golem released the Brass Golem implementation in April 2018, allowing Providers to earn GNT by contributing computer power and requestors to spend GNT on available compute power. The first target use case is for CGI rendering, allowing requestors to distribute processing of any Blender or LuxRenderer scene over the Golem Network.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Brass Golem","date":"2018-04-30T04:00:00Z","type":"Mainnet Launch","details":"Version 1 launched on mainnet"},{"title":"Clay Golem","date":null,"type":null,"details":"Developer integration through Task API"},{"title":"Stone Golem","date":null,"type":null,"details":"Full task API"},{"title":"Iron Golem","date":null,"type":null,"details":"External data link"}],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[]},"advisors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[]},"investors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[{"slug":"bagholder-capital","name":"BagHolder Capital","logo":null,"description":"BagHolder is an investment firm committed to exceptional returns for investors through actively managed portfolios of different blockchain assets.\n\nWith team members ranging from blockchain analysts \u0026 developers to leaders in commercial real estate \u0026 conventional finance, BagHolder has an incredibly wide range of insight and a deep understanding of this space on both a micro and macro level."},{"slug":"nirvana-capital","name":"Nirvana Capital","logo":null,"description":"Nirvana Capital is a San Francisco/Beijing based blockchain fund that focuses on primary market investment and exploration in edging ideas of technology and economics.

The Golem ecosystem is comprised of three main groups; requestors, providers, and software developers. The team believes the network will be more price-competitive than traditional cloud compute services, incentivizing users to choose Golem.\n\nRequestors are users who want to access the shared compute power in the network in exchange for GNT. Requestors can run specific tasks through the Golem app which aggregates the available compute power in the network. Golem provides a native application in which users can run their tasks and track various metrics.\n\nProviders are users who contribute their hardware to add compute power to the network supercomputer. Because Golem aggregates computing power across providers, these users can provide hardware ranging from individual PCs to full data centers. Providers can choose what fraction of contributed hardware they want to add to the network as well as the price to use their compute power. Requestors pay providers in GNT.\n\nProcesses are run in a sandbox to prevent a requestor from gaining access to other services on a providers system while also protecting the files of requestors. In the future, the team envisions a community of software developers who create and develop their own applications for the ecosystem. Currently, Golem is creating the necessary developer tools to onboard prospective software developers, including an application registry where developers can publish their applications and requestors can easily search and find the specific applications and tools they need. The community will leverage the application registry to maintain quality control through a decentralized rewards and reputation system. \n\nRequirements to run Golem\n2 GB RAM\n2 cores\n20 GB HDD\npublic IP or ability to forward ports or router with UPnP activated\nFor more demanding renders like the Production Benchmark  you need\n16 GB RAM\n6 cores","client_repositories":[{"name":"Golem

The team raised money through an ICO in September, 2017 and launched the mainnet in February, 2018. \n\nKyber functions by aggregating liquidity from reserves which are operated by reserve managers. These managers are responsible for maintaining liquidity in the trading pairs offered and updating bid and ask spreads. For their services, managers are compensated through the spread in each transaction. Further, anyone with additional capital can contribute to reserve pools and receive a return. \n\nThere are currently three types of reserve managers: Fed Price Reserve utilizes off-chain price feeds and calculates conversation rates, Automated Price Reserve uses an algorithm to automatically determine prices based on relative liquidity, and Orderbook Reserve which is the only trustless method that uses a fully on-chain orderbook.  \n\nServices such as wallets, vendors, or decentralized applications can build on top of Kyber to access the pools of capital consisting of the aggregate of all reserves. Users of these services can swap tokens with their order being executed at the best price available. This incentivizes reserve managers to ensure they keep their prices competitive and to make markets in lower liquidity tokens where they can take larger spreads.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[{"slug":"victor-tran","first_name":"Victor","last_name":"Tran","title":"Co-founder \u0026 Lead Engineer","description":"Victor Tran is a senior backend engineer and Linux system administrator.

It is based on the BitShares DPoS consensus and has been observed in several other cryptocurrencies such as EOS, Tron and Steem. Every LSK token holder can vote for up to 101 delegates, where the weight of the vote is given by the account balance. The 101 delegates with the largest overall weight are called active delegates. These active delegates propose news blocks that are added to the Lisk blockchain and validated by every node in the network. Any account can become a delegate, but only the 101 accounts with the most votes weighted by stake are allowed to generate blocks. A delegated party is rewarded for securing the network with LSK tokens starting with 5 LSK up until block number 1,451,520 and then reduces by 1 for every 3 million validated

The long-term goal of the team is to transition to a fully decentralized exchange model. \n\nCurrently, the exchange operates through more of a centralized model, attempting to duplicate best practices in traditional asset exchanges including dedicated risk and compliance teams. These teams are responsible for internal controls and cross-departmental reviews aimed at reducing fraudulent activity on the platform.\n\nKuCoin Shares (KCS) is a token used to reward users and attract new customers to the exchange. Users holding a specified amount of KCS in their account are eligible for discounts on trading fees. Furthermore, holders of KCS receive a daily dividend, called a KuCoin bonus, equal to 50% of trading fees on the exchange. Those that have referred new users to the platform are eligible to receive 40% of fees while the exchange retains the remaining 10%. Dividends are paid in whichever token was the most traded during the day.\n\nTo encourage referrals, each user receives a registration link they can share. Referral bonuses are paid for both direct and indirect activity. Users receive bonuses for both the activity of their direct referrals as well as the activity from any new users their referrals add to the platform. Users holding enough KCS in their exchange account receive a discount on trading fees. KCS held off-exchange is not eligible for this rebate program. Additional benefits such as a personal investment consultation and expedited customer service are offered to users on a tiered basis as they increase their KCS holdings.\n\nWhile trading rebates and referrals are the current use case for KCS KuCoin plans to use the token for transaction fees once they launch a fully decentralized platform. Current trading fees on the exchange are 0.1% at the time of this report.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[]},"advisors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[]},"investors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[{"slug":"neo-global-capital","name":"NEO Global Capital","logo":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1163720388519424002/u-RTzHhi_400x400.jpg","description":"NEO Global Capital is the strategic investment vehicle NEO foundation and one of the largest institutional owners of cryptocurrencies."}]},"ecosystem":{"assets":[],"organizations":[]},"economics":{"token":{"token_name":"KuCoin Shares","token_type":"ERC-20","token_address":"0x039b5649a59967e3e936d7471f9c3700100ee1ab","block_explorers":null,"multitoken":[],"token_usage":"Discount","token_usage_details":null},"launch":{"general":{"launch_style":"Private Sale","launch_details":null},"fundraising":{"sales_rounds":[],"sales_documents":[],"sales_treasury_accounts":[],"treasury_policies":null,"projected_use_of_sales_proceeds":[]},"initial_distribution":{"initial_supply":null,"initial_supply_repartition":{"allocated_to_investors_percentage":null,"allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage":null,"allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage":null},"token_distribution_date":null,"genesis_block_date":null}},"consensus_and_emission":{"supply":{"supply_curve_details":"KuCoin completed a public token sale on Sep. 1, 2017, creating 200 million KCS following the sale.

All user data is encrypted and stored in line with these standards. To minimize the chances for disruptions the operations team is split between two sites in Hong Kong and Singapore. Three data centers are maintained with overlapping functionality so operations for the entire business can be run using any of the centers.\n\nThe trading system is designed to handle high trading volumes, up to one million orders per second, through desktop and mobile interfaces.\n\nKuCoin uses multiple wallets with varying levels of security based on the time frame for transactions. Micro-transactions are supported through a multi-firewall private network built on Amazon Web Services. KuCoin employees are provided with a unique cipher code to initiate withdrawals from the wallet. Longer term holdings are stored in bank custody with multiple signatures via independent private keys required to access them.\n\nWithdrawal requests are first inspected using an internal artificial intelligence algorithm designed to process transactions instantly while still maintaining risk and security measures. KuCoin also offers multifactor authentication for transactions. \n\nKuCoin hopes to release a feature whereby exchange participants can self-register new cryptocurrency pairs and start trading automatically to help reach the goal of having 1,000 tokens listed and a daily exchange volume exceeding 100,000 BTC by December 2018. \n\nTokens that fail to meet ongoing listing standards are not immediately delisted on the exchange but are instead put under special treatment rules. Projects may fall under this classification if they are likely to cease activities during the next three months, fail to have enough volume to make markets, appear insolvent, fail an audit, fail to report details in a timely fashion, engage in malicious market activities, dissolve the founding team, or any other reason at the discretion of KuCoin. \n\nProjects in special treatment are designated as such on the platform, so exchange participants are aware the associated token is a candidate for delisting. \n\nAt the end of the observation, period tokens are delisted if they continue not to meet the volume required for listing or the project does not take the necessary actions to remedy the reason special treatment was applied. Alternatively, if a project passes the review, it is restored to the platform in good standing, and the special treatment designation is removed.","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":null,"onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":"No

is creating a decentralized open-source prediction market platform and oracle service. The project was founded in 2014 and released an alpha version of the platform in June 2015. Due to issues with the Serpent language, which pre-dated Solidity, the team had to re-write their code in Solidity leading to a delay in development. Augur launched their beta in March 2016 and mainnet in July 2018. \n\nPrediction markets on the platform will enable users to create a market for forecasting a specific future event, such as who will win the next election or which team will win the World Cup. Participants in the market will be able to buy “shares” of the specific outcome they see as most likely. At the end of a pre-determined period the outcome is checked and those that own shares in the correct result receive a monetary reward. Prediction markets can be useful tools in tracking the true sentiment for results, as typically only the most informed individuals will risk money when making a prediction.\n\nThe team believes that by creating a fully decentralized prediction market they can overcome issues seen in centralized markets such as needing to trust that a result is correctly reported and that a payout is received. In addition, by creating a framework for the creation of these markets users can forecast the outcome of almost any event. Once a market is created trading begins immediately. The outcome of the event is determined by Augur’s oracles which are incentivized to report on event outcomes. Upon determination of the outcome, traders can close their positions and collect their payouts.

Once the end date is reached the designated oracle is responsible for providing the outcome of the event, such as who won an election. This designated oracle does not unilaterally decide the outcome of the market, and it can be disputed and corrected by the community. The creator must also choose a resolution source such as “bbc.com” and set a creator fee which is to be paid to the market creator upon trade settlement. Additionally, creators must post a validity bond in REP to incentivize the creation of well-defined events, and a no-show bond to incentivize the creator to pick a reliable reporter. \n\nTrading\nShares can be traded freely upon creation, and market participants forecast the outcomes of events by trading shares of those possible outcomes denominated in ETH. This introduces price volatility as the price can change drastically between the creation and settlement of a market, so v2 of the protocol introduces the use of \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/stablecoins\"\u003establecoins\u003c/a\u003e. Using the Augur matching engine anyone can create or fill an existing order. All Augur assets – including shares in market outcomes, fee window tokens, shares in dispute bonds, and even ownership of the markets themselves are transferable at all times.\n\nReporting\nOnce an event occurs, the outcome is determined by Augur’s oracles, which are profit-driven reporters incentivized to report the true real-world outcome. Anyone who owns REP tokens can participate in reporting and disputing outcomes. Reporters whose outcomes are consistent with consensus are rewarded while those whose outcomes are inconsistent are penalized.  \n\nThe reporting system runs on a seven-day fee window. All fees collected during a respective window are pooled and distributed to the reporters who contributed during that window. Reporters receive rewards in proportion to the amount of REP staked during the fee window. To incentivize consistent participation during each fee window, REP holders can also purchase participation tokens, which are redeemable for a certain portion of the fee pool.  \n\nSettlement\nAugur levies a creator fee and reporter fee when market participants settle trades with the market contract. These fees are proportional to the amount paid out to respective users. The creator fee is set during market creation, and the reporting fee is set dynamically.\n\nSettlement is disrupted if enough REP tokens are staked on the belief the market was not reported correctly (currently 2.5% of all tokens). If this occurs the system forks into two distinct universes for the different outcomes. During this process, all markets are frozen until the dispute is resolved. REP holders are then forced to migrate their tokens to the outcome they believe is correct, essentially \"voting\" with their money. The belief is the market will settle on the true outcome, and developers, service providers and other actors in the ecosystem will naturally continue to build on it.

After the contribution period, SGT could be converted to the ICO token (SNT) so early contributors could “get in” on the ICO token for being a contributor early. Basically, early disbursement of tokens that map to a given percentage of the total.  \nA soft-cap and subsequent “Dynamic Ceilings” were implemented which meant large investments only got a portion of their investment accepted, and the rest was refunded. This was an attempt to increase the time window for smaller investors, and slowly make it more difficult for large investments to get in. The effect of this was for every transaction that got an amount kicked back, there are one regular transaction and two internal transactions.\nStatus raised a total of 299,902.24 ether (ETH) from 20,000 accounts during its token sale.

At its current core the application is a secure messenger, a web3 browser, and a wallet. It is currently available on iOS, Android, Windows, MacOS, and Linux.  V1 of the mobile app is currently going through an extensive security audit and will be released after all found problems are fixed.  The desktop application is currently in alpha stage and will receive more attention after mobile V1\n\nThe secure messenger is actually a communications network and is optimized for privacy, security, and censorship resistance.  Status currently utilizes the Whisper protocol to provide message transport in a decentralized way while also providing obfuscation of routing information.  All messages are then end-to-end-encrypted so that only the users and their intended recipients can read the contents.    \n\nThe wallet manages a user's Ether and associated tokens to provide a single interface for users to manage their funds. It is also accessible inside the messenger, to allow the functionality of sending and receiving digital assets in conversations.  As with the messenger, the wallet is optimized for security, all interaction requires verification on the application side so that the user can be sure they are interacting with who they think they are in the way they intend.\n\nThe web3 browser allows a user to safely and securely browse decentralized applications on Ethereum, linking their preferred wallet account to interact.\n\nStatus has built multiple decentralized applications to enable users to interact with each other in new ways powered by the Ethereum network and SNT.  Features include unique username by staking SNT which leverages the ENS.  There is also a community curated \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-applications-dapps\"\u003edApp\u003c/a\u003e store which projects can stake tokens to get ranked which is governed by a bonded curve.  The more they stake, the higher they rank while simultaneously giving more power to users to downvote them. The Teller Network is a permissionless network enabling fiat-to-crypto exchange. There is also a new project funding and management framework to allow anyone to submit, fund, and manage projects in hopes to incentivize an open community of developers in the Status network.\t\t","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"SNT Contract audits","date":null,"type":null,"details":"[https://github.com/status-im/status-network-token/tree/master/audits](https://github.com/status-im/status-network-token/tree/master/audits)"},{"title":"Beta App audit","date":null,"type":null,"details":"[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wB5pGPaNsQwq2udV7NmHkLuW-2JCMbnV/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wB5pGPaNsQwq2udV7NmHkLuW-2JCMbnV/view)"},{"title":"Sticker Market audit","date":null,"type":null,"details":"[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwORJkLjymjF7Z8UmNIURr9tlCjt7eI0qtcRYuJRPEA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zwORJkLjymjF7Z8UmNIURr9tlCjt7eI0qtcRYuJRPEA/edit?usp=sharing)"},{"title":"Trail of Bits v1 Audit","date":"2019-11-20T05:00:00Z","type":"Security","details":"Trail of Bits kicked off a security audit of Status' v1 social app codebase on Sep. 30, 2019.

The team believes that by using a distributed, cryptographically secured database users can gain greater control of who access their data and how it is stored, reducing identity theft and increasing access to identity for many in areas where government services are lacking. Civic imagines a broad set of applications such as travel documentation, banking, credit, and web credentials.\n\nPersonal identification services are currently provided via the Civic mobile app. The app allows users to upload their personal data which is stored locally on their device using encryption and biometric locks. Storing data in this way gives the user full control over their data and can remove the risks involved with Civic holding user data in a central database.\n\nCurrent services are not fully decentralized and rely on the company to verify a user’s credentials before validating them for use. After verification, an attestation is added to the blockchain providing proof-of-ownership for users. Requestors can confirm that the details being provided by a user belong to that user by checking the attestation provided on the blockchain.\n\nIn the future, using the Civic (CVC) token as an incentive, the team plans to create a fully decentralized system. Civic believes that the future system will allow users complete control over how their information is verified and remove the ability for governments or other organizations to censor data, which they see as compelling enough to make a blockchain potentially worth the cost and inefficiency involved in building a distributed system","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Full Production Release of Identity.com","date":"2018-09-30T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Civic Marketplace Becomes Identity.com, MVP SDK available for select Identity Validators \u0026 Identity Requestors, Smart Contracts are available, Validators are able to set prices at fiat rates and Requesters are able to purchase CVCs with fiat currency on external exchanges"},{"title":"Open Source Identity.com Launched","date":"2018-12-31T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Identity.com open to all participants, Identity Validator Toolkit built"},{"title":"Identity.com Growth \u0026 3rd Party Validator Integration","date":"2019-03-31T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Identity Validator Toolkit is available for 3rd party Validators, Validation Module for IDV \u0026 Credential Wallet Toolkits available, Release of initial Identity.com Credential Schemas"},{"title":"Requester Toolkit available for direct Integration to Identity.com ","date":"2019-06-30T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Requester and Validators are able to dynamically convert CVC and Fiat currencies in their identity.com processes, Requesters are able to configure additional ID Validators as Fallback Providers"},{"title":"Interoperability expansion","date":"2019-09-30T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Archive Credential Interoperability with other SSI Network Implementations"}],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[{"slug":"vinny-lingham","first_name":"Vinny","last_name":"Lingham","title":"CEO Civic","description":"Vinny Lingham is an internet entrepreneur who is currently the co­founder \u0026 CEO of Civic Technologies, Inc ­ a startup company that has a goal to eliminate new account fraud and prevent identity theft by creating an \"Identity Network” where consumers can confirm their identity in real­time with participating merchants and vendors.

Compared to the traditional initial public offering (IPO) process used in equity markets the team hopes to use tokens to decrease the costs for organizations to issue securities while allowing more investors to participate in offerings.\n\nWhile recent token sales, or \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/initial-coin-offering-ico\"\u003einitial coin offerings (ICOs)\u003c/a\u003e, have focused on payment tokens used to transfer value or utility tokens used to access goods or services on a platform, all tokens issued through Polymath will be securities (\u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/security-token\"\u003esecurity tokens\u003c/a\u003e). Security tokens are specifically intended to represent a stake in an organization or a claim to the wealth generated by its activities. They are therefore subject to security regulations in the case of both issuers and investors.\n\nPolymath plans to offer a blockchain-based issuance system that allows organizations to create tokens and engage service providers, like law firms and developers, to complete a token sale. Investors will be able to participate in securities token offerings (STOs) and trade their tokens on a secondary market. Polymath plans to integrate third-party know your customer (KYC) providers to verify details about issuers, investors, and service providers, including location and accredited investor status. The integration of KYC and legal service providers aims to allow issuers and investors to comply with various regulations across jurisdictions.\n\nTokens created on the network will be based on Polymath’s ST20 standard which incorporates KYC compliance into the token. This should create a system where only investors, as identified by Ethereum addresses, that match the regulatory profile (location, accredited investor status, etc.) outlined by the organization are able to purchase tokens. ST20 tokens will be modular and can be changed over time to reflect new governance or change features such as dividend payments.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"First smart contracts launched on Ethereum","date":"2018-01-30T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":null},{"title":"ST20 launches on Ethereum","date":"2018-05-30T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Includes Polymath ST20 security tokens and the Polymath Token Studio dApp"},{"title":"Security Token Roundtable ","date":"2018-07-30T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Polymath kicks off focus on standardization with Security Token Roundtable in Barbados"},{"title":"ST20 - v1.0","date":"2018-08-30T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"ST20 goes live on Ethereum mainnet"},{"title":"Initial draft for ERC1400","date":"2018-09-30T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Polymath publishes the ERC1400 draft for industry feedback"},{"title":"ST20 - v2.0","date":"2018-11-30T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"New features including USD tiered STO that raises stablecoin that's pegged to fiat, forced token transfers, and additional dividend functionality "},{"title":"Polymesh blockchain initiative announced","date":"2019-05-30T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Announcement of Polymesh Blockchain Initiative in collaboration with Charles Hoskinson, a discovery process to create the world's first blockchain built for security tokens.

The security tokens known as ST-20 and are fully ERC-1400 compliant. When a new token is launched, a new smart contract is created that manages the specific requirements of that token. Organizations will be able to hire developers to build or review smart contracts directly through the platform. A JavaScript library, Polymath.js, simplifies interaction with the smart contracts and provides document encryption and sharing functionality. The Polymath Token Studio provides an interface for asset issuers to create and manage their ST-20 security tokens as well as providing access to a marketplace of over 40 partner companies who provide services across many categories including legal, marketing, distribution and KYC.\n\nToken Launch/Development\nTo launch a new token, an issuer creates a smart contract with the parameters of their offering including total supply, equity or other rights attached, price, and governance details. Issuers can choose to develop their own contracts or engage a developer through a planned marketplace system. Developers can bid to provide new implementation or review services directly through the platform and will be paid in POLY. The team plans to ensure quality development by locking these tokens for a minimum of three months after the launch of an STO.  \n\nLegal\nOnce a contract has been deployed, law firms, called legal delegates, will be able to bid for the new offering. Issuers will be unable to complete their token sale until they complete a legal review process. Legal delegates can submit proposals during this time and if selected will be responsible for working with the issuer to properly construct a compliant token sale. Like developers, legal delegates will be compensated for their work in POLY. Delegates may choose to stake an amount of POLY or set various lock-up periods before they can receive compensation as a way to guarantee the quality of their work.  \n\nToken Sale\nAfter an issuer approves the final offering, they set the sale date and investors are allowed to purchase the security. To participate in a sale, investors are required to go through a KYC process to verify their location (jurisdiction) and accredited investor status. Issuers and their legal delegates set parameters directly through the smart contract that can do things like include only accredited investors or exclude certain jurisdictions. These parameters will be encoded directly to the token so that even in the secondary market any investor must meet the original requirements. Investors will be identified by their Ethereum addresses which helps to build a transaction history and audit trail for assets on the network.\n\nKYC services will be provided by third-parties that verify investor credentials in return for POLY. These providers will be required to pay a fee to join the network to attempt to prevent illegitimate providers from participating. To facilitate the trusted sharing of documents things like legal paperwork and investor credentials can be uploaded to the Polymath platform and accompanied by a cryptographic hash on the blockchain creating a verifiable archive of documents.","client_repositories":[{"name":"Polymath GitHub","link":"https://github.com/PolymathNetwork","license_type":"MIT License and GNU Affero General Public License"}]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"Polymath Audit","date":"2018-02-13T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Open Zeppelin [audited ](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/polymath-audit-be55e9936aba/)the POLY token contract "},{"title":"Audit Report for Polymath Token Distribution","date":"2018-01-09T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Solidified [audited ](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-token/blob/master/audits/solidified%20audit%20report%20-%20polymath%20token.pdf)the Token Distribution contracts"},{"title":"Audit Report for Polymath USDTieredSTO module","date":"2018-08-07T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Solidified [audited ](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-core/blob/master/audit%20reports/Polymath%20Audit%20Report%20-%20STO%20Modules%20.pdf)the Polymath USDTieredSTO module and its auxiliary files"},{"title":"Audit Report for Polymath Core Tore release","date":"2018-07-07T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Solidified [audited ](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-core/blob/master/audit%20reports/Polymath%20Audit%20Report%20Final.pdf)the Polymath Core Tore release"},{"title":"Audit Report for Polymath Core 2.0.0 release","date":"2018-10-18T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Solidified [audited ](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-core/blob/master/audit%20reports/Polymath%20Core%202.0.0%20Audit%20Report%20.pdf)the Polymath Core 2.0.0 release"},{"title":"Polymath-Core Audit","date":"2019-09-30T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"ConsenSys Diligence conducted a [security audit](https://github.com/PolymathNetwork/polymath-core/blob/master/audit%20reports/V3%20Audit%20Report%20by%20Consensys%20Diligence%20-%20April%202019.pdf) on the Polymath Core smart contracts"}],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":"There is no formal governance process for upgrading smart contracts on Polymath.

The mainnet went live on 01 January 2018. The unique parent-child chain architecture of Ardor, with a single security chain providing energy-efficient proof of stake consensus for multiple transactional “child chains,” enables three fundamental advantages – reduced blockchain bloat, increased scalability, and the ability to launch and host ready-to-use interconnected blockchains. \n\nARDR tokens are used to secure the network through a process called, “forging.” Since all tokens have been distributed and the supply will never increase, “forging” nodes are rewarded from the transaction fees in each block of transactions. \n\nThe advanced features and functionality available on Nxt were implemented on the public and permissionless Ignis child chain – along with new features such as lightweight smart contracts, account and asset controls, and composite phased transactions. Businesses can launch dApps and services using the features available on Ignis such as issuing and trading digital assets and nonfungible tokens (NFTs), launching voting systems, and leveraging distributed cloud storage.\n\nAlternatively, businesses and developers use the built-in KYC/AML features to run a complaint Security Token Offering (STO), pick from the features on Ignis, launch their own child chain, and simply plug in to the security provided by the decentralized Ardor parent chain’s network using the innovative “bundler” system. \n\nBundlers are nodes that collect transaction fees in the native child chain token, while paying with ARDR tokens to send the child chain transactions for validation on the parent chain. Five custom bundler templates are built-in to the platform to enable app and child chain owners to sponsor the transaction fees for only their intended end-users, eliminating the need for users to directly interface with the blockchain.","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":null,"onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":"No

creating more efficient infrastructures. The network is a “digital jurisdiction” governed by stakeholders that can vote to create or amend laws included in the network’s “constitution”. Operation of the network is supported by fees which are collected from organizations and allocated based on the underlying governance model.   \n\nThe core Aragon platform provides contracts that power the operations of decentralized organizations, as well as the contract upgradeability services and bug bounty mechanisms. The network’s decentralized “court” can resolve issues between organizations that leverage the aragonOS smart contract infrastructure as a governance system.   \n\nAragon’s “court” serves as the backbone for the system’s decentralized governance. The court works at three different levels. First, the network assigns five random judges, who are required to stake ANT tokens to vote and resolve disputes. The judging process is set up as a prediction market where judges are incentivized to correctly bet on which party is right or wrong in a dispute. Dissenting (minority) judges lose their bonded stakes, which are paid to the winning judges.   \n\nPlaintiff’s in Aragon disputes are also required to post a stake of tokens, or, bond. If they lose, they can walk away with some of their stake, or double down and appeal by increasing the bond. This makes the case public to the entire network of judges and the voting process is repeated. If the plaintiff still doesn’t agree with the outcome of the network-wide judging, they may increase their bond again and appeal to the network’s Supreme Court, which is governed by the top nine judges in the network as measured by reputation, something earned through a combination of stake and prior prediction accuracy.   \n\nBy making it possible for anyone in the world to organize digitally, Aragon seeks to enable borderless, permissionless entity creation and governance.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Aragon Toolkit","date":null,"type":null,"details":"Enable developers to build their own frontends powered by Aragon"},{"title":"Aragon Network Phase 3","date":null,"type":null,"details":"Transition full governance powers of the Aragon Network to ANT holders"},{"title":"Aragon Court Precedence Campaign","date":null,"type":null,"details":"Campaign with bogus disputes in order to stress-test the robustness of Aragon Court"}],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":"Aragon is not regulated any financial regulator.

Purchasers received 120 ANT per ETH, a 20% discount over the public sale price, and were subject to a 6-month vesting schedule with a 3-month cliff. Institutional buyers CoinFund, ICONOMI, and ShapeShift could contribute the equivalent of $40,000 in ETH, while personal buyers could contribute up to $10,000 ETH. For liquidity purposes, ShapeShift was allowed to purchase an additional $20,000 ETH worth of ANT which were not discounted or subject to vesting. \n\nThis enabled Aragon to fund the necessary development and operations to make the public sale possible. Presale proceeds were allocated as follows: approximately 50 ETH to security audits, approximately 208 ETH to legal expenses, approximately 107 ETH to public relations, approximately 134 ETH to advertisements, approximately 212 ETH to Ethereum name service, and approximately 15 ETH to miscellaneous expenses. \n\nThe public sale ended on May 17, 2017, after raising 275,000 ETH (roughly $25 million at the time) at a rate of 100 ANT per ETH. Public sale contributors were not subject to vesting or lock-up periods. Aragon stated that 70% of the ICO proceeds went to purchasers, 15% to the Foundation and the remaining 15% to the founders and early contributors who have worked on the project. A hidden cap mechanism was employed prior to the token offering to attract smaller buyers and ensure a more even token distribution and longer sale period. However, the founders made the decision to reveal the hidden cap, which was 275,000 ETH, before the sale’s start due to the large queue of transactions threatening the Ethereum infrastructure. The cap was hit in less than 30 minutes. \n\nUpon the close of the offering, the total supply of the network was 39.6 million ANT. Aragon stated that the total supply will be constant only until Aragon’s network is deployed.

Service protocols include DAO creation and management (Aragon Client), online dispute resolution (Aragon Court) and transaction processing (Aragon Chain). These collective smart contracts are responsible for asset custody, payments, voting, dispute resolution and transaction processing.  For enhanced usability, users are able to create or interact with a DAO using a variety of connecting wallets such as Metamask or Fortmatic. In the case of the latter, users just require an email or phone number, effectively limiting user friction when interacting with Aragon protocols.  \n\nIn order to create a DAO, a user has the option of selecting various templates with plug and play governance modules to fit their community. During the setup stage, there are a number of parameters that need to be entered such as the voting settings. Many of these parameters can later be changed by token holders of the DAO. Once the parameters are chosen and gas fees have been paid, the DAO contract is deployed to the Ethereum network and has its own DAO address.   \n\nDevelopers may also choose to install apps into specific DAOs, directly from the Aragon CLI.   \n\nWhen it comes to interacting with the DAOs, token holders are able to do so directly through Aragon Client or through custom front ends built with Aragon Connect.  Aragon also features a registry that lists every DAO created on Aragon together with various metrics such as value of asset helds or number of transactions.   \n\nOnce created, DAO members may want legal assurance from interacting with members or other DAOs. Aragon Court is able to handle subjective disputes that cannot be solved by smart contracts. Aragon Court attempts to find what the subjective truth is with a Schelling game. Jurors are asked to vote on the ruling that they think their fellow jurors are more likely to vote on. Jurors that vote with the consensus ruling are rewarded with ruling fees and juror tokens from the jurors that voted for a minority ruling.  \n\nCertain service protocols such as Aragon Court and Aragon Chain employ the use of bonding curves to create Continuous Tokens that are bonded to ANT. A bonding curve is an automated market maker smart contract that defines a relationship between token price and token supply. Using Continuous Tokens for specific service protocols instead of a single token for the entire network makes it easier for the community to analyse the risks and rewards of each protocol. It also enables community members to engage more deeply in network services areas where they have the strongest interests.

platform. The project aims to build an Ethereum-based platform that allows licensed third-party operators to build blockchain based casino games. By creating games on a public blockchain the team believes they can offer transparency and prevent cheating by casino operators or players. FunFair aims to engineer a peer-to-peer casino that removes typical casino middlemen and eliminates costly server racks, providing gamers with larger payouts when they win and reducing overhead costs for casino operators. The platform plans to support standard games, such as blackjack, slots, craps, and other games that are designed by FunFair Technologies or other third parties. \n\nDespite operating on a public network, the underlying technology is not open source, except for what is needed to make the games provably fair. FunFair plans to create value through their intellectual property, including their platform, games, and other proprietary technology while eventually making most of their project open-source without revealing the intellectual property that gives them a competitive advantage. The firm’s business model focuses on selling access to their platform through white label casino operators and licenses to affiliates that market or refer players to casinos. FunFair Technologies will not mandate third party game developers to open source their designs, except for the parts necessary to ensure provably fair gaming. \n\nFunFair (FUN) tokens power the entire FunFair platform. Players are required to use FUN to place bets and any winnings are paid out in FUN tokens by casinos. FUN tokens will be utilized to incentivize game developers, pay affiliate license fees, white label fees, game transaction fees, and any other platform services. \n\nWhile FunFair is currently testing their beta version and providing demo versions of their games on the FunFair website, some of their demo games are currently testable on the Ethereum test network.

FUN tokens are used to power the smart contracts which run the platform and FunFair’s unique random number generator. The team believes that their unique approach to random number generators can allow for a wider range of games on the platform compared to oracle or block hash models. FunFair is developing a proprietary innovation called “fate channels”, which are a modified version of state channels. Fate channels will commit partial seeds from a random number generator to the blockchain before the start of a gaming session. Funds are committed and locked in a smart contract in advance, and all transactions between parties are progressively signed. The final state is sent back to the Ethereum blockchain and verified so that all parties agree on the outcome, thereby allowing the respective parties to withdraw their funds.\n\nFate channels are based on the work done by state channels, similar to Bitcoin’s lightning network, allowing participants to engage in a rapid back-and-forth countersigning of updated “claims” on escrowed funds. Fate channels can enable a fast, low-cost method for random number generation, starting and ending gaming sessions and finally settling sessions with smart contracts on the blockchain. Because only the final state is added to the Ethereum blockchain this scheme can reduce transaction fees (gas) and ensure that both parties involved in a game session behave fairly by requiring co-signing state transitions. Interactions between a casino and the players will predominantly be off-chain, including execution of the smart contracts, unless there is a dispute which will then require execution being sent on-chain to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFUN tokens will be used by players to bet or play games within the online casino. Game developers and casino affiliates are rewarded in FUN and all fees will be paid in FUN. Any FUN tokens used for game transaction or fate channel fees may be burned for the first two years of operations, although this has not been confirmed by FunFair because some regulators have stated they would classify this as a form of dividend.\n\nFunFair will be a browser based online gaming platform utilizing HTML5 and WebGL standards on both mobile devices and desktop computers. Casinos will not control any players funds, instead player always control their funds and place bets directly from their wallet. This will allow players to cash out whenever they want and ensure that they always maintain complete control over their winnings.

A total of 72 million STORJ was distributed to the public through the pre and main sale, raising $30 million for the project. A further 20.66 million SJCX remained outstanding and were eligible for conversion into STORJ and a 1:1 rate up until Dec. 2017. The 450 million SJCX tokens held by Storj were converted into 450 million STORJ tokens during this time. \n\nA total of 125 million STORJ tokens have been publicly distributed to date. This includes 2.99 million STORJ tokens paid out to service providers, 72 million STORJ sold to the public, and 50 million legacy SJCX tokens, which includes legacy SJCX reserved for conversion. \n\nFollowing these distributions Storj retained 375 million, of which 75 million have been burned, leaving the project with 300 million tokens. Of these, 245 million remain locked until June 20, 2018, having initially been scheduled to be released on Dec. 20, 2017. The remaining 55 million tokens are unlocked and available for use by Storj to pay service providers, including farmers. \n\nAs a result of the burning of 75 million tokens, the total token supply stands at 425 million. \n\nThere remains a lack of clarity regarding the release of the remaining tokens held by Storj, following the decision to extend the lock-up period until June 2018. The project has indicated that they have enough funds to operate until this date, at which time they can better evaluate the project’s timeline.

Clients maintain the only copy of the encryption key after upload. \n\nOver the duration of a contract, the protocol allows clients to check that a farmer still maintains their file and that it is retrievable. If a farmer is able to provide cryptographic proof that a file is on their system they receive payment for that period. If they are unable to provide this proof the client does not pay.

hedge fund that utilizes artificial intelligence and crowdsourced stock market predictions. The platform relies on a monthly machine learning and data science “tournament” where users, primarily data scientists, can submit trading algorithms about the stock market. Numerai then employs artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze the predictions, and the best are included in Numerai’s “meta-model” which combines all the underlying inputs on which it will trade the stock market.\n\nThe team believes there are inefficiencies in the stock market-related capital allocation and that creating a free and open dataset for machine learning will help solve this problem. Numerai claims that inefficiencies are in part due to assigning metrics to market data, such as stock price or dividends. Each month users are given an encrypted dataset that has standard market data labels removed. By removing the context of data the project believes users will submit more accurate predictions. For example, stock price could be labeled as “feature 1”, so users create stock prediction models objectively based on historical data as opposed to using personal biases about how stock price might affect a specific company. Numerai encrypts the dataset that tournament participants are given to prevent participants from copying the underlying trading strategy.\n\nBy giving the dataset away for free the team believes it will allow for open participation by users around the world, fostering a collaborative approach and generating better prediction models compared to typical hedge funds.\n\nIn Feb. 2017, the company announced its token, Numeraire (NMR), an ERC20 token used to participate in tournaments on the platform. The platform utilizes a “skin in the game” model where users are required to stake NMR to receive NMR for their accurate predictions. If the overall hedge fund performs well, they will distribute those returns in the form of NMR to users.

Every chain, even forks, are more connected under dPoW than regular PoW which Komodo prefers. \n\nKomodo's Iguana Core technology, a multi-purpose code base that underlies the Komodo protocol, spawned the security model behind dPoW. Iguana Core and dPoW rely on Notary Nodes chosen by the Komodo network users to archive \"true\" copies of the network's transaction history and designate the appropriate chain for miners to direct their resources. Notary nodes occasionally receive easy-mining privileges on a lottery basis where the network's difficulty significantly decreases for one of the notary nodes. Every 2000 blocks, every notary node can mine on easy-level difficulty in a Komodo mining \"free-for-all\". \n\nKomodo supports two separate but parallel chains: an asset chain and a main chain (a quasi-layer-two feature). Notary nodes maintain the main chain, but the asset chain can process significantly more transactions in a given time frame than the main chain. Asset developers shoulder the responsibility of bootstrapping a network of nodes to maintain the security of assets issued on the Komodo asset chain though. \n\nBarterDEX is the Komodo blockchain's native decentralized exchange (DEX) that functions like any cryptocurrency exchange with order matching, liquidity provision, and transaction clearing. Jumblr is a transaction data anonymizing feature that serves as Komodo's primary tool for targeting on-chain privacy. As a Zcash fork, Komodo retained some of it's parent project's privacy features. But Jumblr relies on BarterDEX, KMD, and Zcash's parameters to attempt the level of security desired by the Komodo team.

Users can either use the complete Blockchain operating system or develop a customized OS by redefining the core through new interfaces.\n\nEach node is a cluster network (e.g., a cloud network) instead of a single computer. By leveraging cloud networks as nodes, ælf aims to provide network participants with higher computational power as well as the storage capability. A parallel processing algorithm will be developed and integrated to each node to ensure the optimal utilization of all the participating computers in the cloud network. When a node handles a complex set of transactions within a smart contract, it will dissect the transactions into groups of those that do not demonstrate interdependency and process them in parallel, simultaneously. Consequently, the task time is minimized and the overall processing speed maximized. A node’s capacity can be easily scaled by adding new computers to the existing network without having to upgrade the node computer’s hardware.\n\nælf operates as a multi-chain network where each side chain is independent and smart contracts are executed directly from a side chain, not through the main chain. Side chains aim to localize traffic concentration thereby enabling consistent transaction speed for smart contracts on other side chains. Each side chain will have the ability to host an independent set of nodes allowing it to determine its own processing speed.\n\nSide chains will be established for a specific business scenario, e.g., token issuance (ICO), an insurance database, in-game transactions, etc., and their consensus protocol, node delegation, chain privacy and various other chain qualities can be tailored to best support the specific business scenario. The main chain acts as the ledger and communications hub, focused on efficient cross chain communication, triggering of smart contracts across side chains, and effective synchronization between chains with different speeds.\n\nOver time ælf aims to bestow its network participants an entirely self-evolving authority through its voting protocol. ELF holders will have the ability vote on a diverse sets of critical decisions that will collectively shape the eco-system; this includes the decision for each side chain to host their own delegated node, choose whether the participating side chain will be public or private, determine the size and the speed of the side chain, remove or add side chains to the network, etc. The project utilizes Merkle tree root based chain indexing to communicate and interoperate with other consensus protocols such as PoW and PoS. ælf provides side chain templates to its developers for rapid smart contract development for those who do not have the in-depth understanding and capacity for ground-up smart contract coding.\n\nTechnical development will be led by Beijing Hoopox Information and Technology Co., Ltd. Founded in June 2016, Hoopox focuses on providing Blockchain-based solutions for various industries. Hoopox received funding of USD 4.3 million (RMB 28 million) from seven VCs, including China Growth Capital, Draper Dragon, WeX Fintech, Taoshi Capital, Danhua Capital, and Albatross Venture, and FBG

Dan, who previously founded Bitshares, acted as CTO until 2017 when he resigned to work on his next project, EOS. The Steem network is built on the same technology that powers BitShares, Graphene, which sustains 1000 transactions per second (tps) and has the possibility to scale to 10,000 tps with improvements to server capacity and communication protocols. Similar to social media like Facebook or Reddit, Steem includes a voting mechanism to bring the most engaging content to its users.\n\nSteem's Token Variety\nSteem introduces a new incentive model and Sybil resistance mechanism that incorporates multiple native cryptoassets: \nSTEEM - The fundamental unit of account from which other tokens derive their value. It's liquid and can be bought and sold on exchanges. \nSteem Power (SP) - STEEM that has been committed to a thirteen-week vesting schedule in which it cannot be transferred. When users vote on content, their influence on how the rewards are distributed is directly proportional to the amount of SP owned. SP also gives holders the right to 15% of the annual inflation, based on a percentage of the total SP owned. \nSteem Dollars (SBD) - SBD acts as a stablecoin to lower the cognitive costs of using the network. They are created in a similar fashion to convertible notes in the startup world and there are terms allowing holders to convert to STEEM with minimum notice at the fair market price of the token. To prevent the token-convertible dollar from creating too much debt in the system, the blockchain automatically reduces the amount of STEEM generated through conversions to a maximum of 10% of the markets hare ensuring there will never be a debt-to-ownership ratio higher than 10%. \n\nCreating SBD requires a reliable feed and a system is in place where SP holders elect witnesses who are paid to publish price feeds. If a feed producer tries publishing outliers, they will likely be in the minority and their reputation will be tarnished decreasing their chance of remaining voted in. \n\nGovernance Breakdown\nThe community operates under a one STEEM for one vote process where individuals who have contributed the most as measured by STEEM balance have the most influence on contribution scoring. The platform only allows members to vote when STEEM is committed to a vesting schedule, creating SP. Steem also rewards voters proportionally based on the ultimate reward paid to the content creator. Posts receive payouts in either 50% SBD/50% SP or 100% SP, and they also have the option to decline in which case the money remains in the rewards pool to be distributed later.\n\nTron Foundation Drama and Hive Hard Fork\nOn Feb. 14, 2020, the Tron Foundation announced it acquired Steemit Inc., the for-profit firm behind the Steemit application, as well as the company's substantial STEEM holdings (known as the ninja-mined stake). Steem witnesses (akin to validators) voted to remove the governance rights from Tron's newly acquire STEEM tokens as a \"protective measure.\" Tron reportedly retaliated by coordinating enough support to reverse these governance restrictions. The concerns over network centralization pushed the Steem community to \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/article/onchainfx-alert-steem-community-plans-a-hard-fork-to-cut-out-tron-owned-steemit\"\u003emove to a new chain\u003c/a\u003e, called Hive, which went live on Mar. 20, 2020.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Mainnet Launch","date":"2016-03-24T04:00:00Z","type":"Network Change","details":"Steemit co-founders Ned Scott and Dan Larimer helped launch the Steem blockchain in Mar. 2016.

A target utilization is set that leaves enough room for short-term surges and when the surges are sustained, the blockchain reduces the maximum bandwidth per share. Any time an individual user's moving average bandwidth exceeds the current network limit, their transaction is delayed until their average falls below the limit. \n\nTo prevent Sybil attacks, there is also a minimum account balance to be able to make transactions which is typically as low as a dollar. The reasoning behind this being that the opportunity cost of lost interest is a more acceptable cost to users than micro-fees on every transaction. \n\nSteem employs a hierarchical private key structure to facilitate both low and high security transactions. There are posting keys that allow accounts to post, comment, edit, vote; active keys for transferring funds, converting SBD, voting for witnesses, placing market orders; and owner key which is the most powerful key because it can change any key of an account and prove ownership during an account recovery. Steem also uses a master password that encrypts all three keys and allows users to trust certain services to keep improper keys from being transferred across any servers. \n\nAccording to the white paper, Steem can handle 10,000 transactions per second by keeping everything in memory, keeping the core business logic in a single thread, keeping cryptographic operations out of the core business logic, dividing validation into state-dependent and state-independent checks, and using object oriented data model. \n\nSteem released a token protocol called Smart Media Tokens (SMTs) that allow the creation of arbitrary tokens that can be used to align incentives between users and applications in platforms with “like” or “upvote” based algorithms. This model empowers websites to adopt sustainable revenue models using these native tokens and Proof-of-Brain which uses subjective human work to distribute tokens. This model enables anyone to start earning money with low barriers to entry by contributing their time to growing a community. \n\nOther features include a native name system that allows users to send tokens to usernames rather than long strings of random letters and numbers, a decentralized exchange to trade STEEM and SBD through a peer-to-peer market with a publicly accessible order book and history, and an escrow payment service to determine if terms of an agreement have been met before funds are released.","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":null,"onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":"Delegated On-Chain Vote","onchain_governance_details":"The community operates under a one STEEM for one vote process where individuals who have contributed the most as measured by STEEM balance have the most influence on contribution scoring.

attempting to build a distributed blockchain based financial market. The team plans to achieve this goal through three pillars; cross chain interoperability, privacy, and smart contracts that give anyone the ability to create or access a suite of applications. Wanchain imagines use cases such as decentralized exchanges, lending, stablecoins, multi-currency payment and settlement, crowdfunding, and many other financial services will be facilitated on the network. The project was created in 2016 by Jack Lu, former co-founder, and CTO at Factom. Wanchain is currently being developed by the Wanchain Foundation, a non-profit organization registered in Singapore.\n\nThe project focuses on the growth of digital assets, including tokenization of traditional assets like stocks and bonds, and how they will interact with existing blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Wanchain plans to build a common framework, including cross-network interoperability, which will allow these different assets and their native ledgers to interact with each other. Initially, the team will focus on integration with Ethereum and plans to include interoperability with any public or private blockchain network.\n\nUsers can choose private transactions through the use of one time addresses, and the team plans to integrate ring-signatures, like those in Monero, in future releases. This is designed to provide the ability to transact privately and provide increased fungibility of assets.  \n\nWanchain also runs an accelerator program called WANLab which seeks to support projects that are building on the Wanchain platform. To date, six projects have been picked for this accelerator program and will receive mentorship and resources from WANLab. Wanchain is part of the “Blockchain Interoperability Alliance,” alongside the AION and ICON projects. The goal of this alliance is to promote interconnectivity between different isolated blockchain networks.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[{"slug":"jack-lu","first_name":"Jack","last_name":"Lu","title":"Founder \u0026 CEO","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1542240000%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3Df8GnuwJUp3sthGlCMd-f5A5c3yQZ8wigaQ99_tkTi2Y"}],"organizations":[{"slug":"wanchain-foundation-ltd","name":"Wanchain Foundation Ltd.","logo":null,"description":"Wanchain is a public blockchain with inter-chain transactions and privacy protection.

The platform uses proof-of-stake (PoS) for consensus but divides verification nodes into three groups; vouchers, storemen, and validators. \n\nNodes are required to stake Wancoin (WAN) in return for the ability to validate transactions on the network. They are compensated in the form of fees for this service. Any dishonest behavior causes their stake to be slashed. The platform aims to\nfacilitate cross-chain interoperability using a series of locked accounts. When sending a cross-chain transaction, assets (value) are not flowing across chains. Instead, they are sent to a locked account that keeps funds on the original chain, akin to a deposit.\nVouchers provide proof of transactions between the original account and the locked account.\n\nFunds are then replicated on Wanchain, and a receipt is generated, showing how much a user can transact with. Locked accounts are created through a cryptographic method called secure multi-party computation (sMPC), which allows for coordination using a public-private address scheme. Storemen are responsible for operations related to locked accounts such as account generation and key management. Private keys are not\nexposed to a single individual during this process, but instead, are divided amongst multiple validators requiring some, or all, to reconstruct the data. This aims to also maintain network integrity if some of the validators are corrupt or offline.\n\nValidators are general verification nodes that record transactions whenever there is consensus. By dividing the nodes into three distinct groups, the team hopes to reduce the chance of collusion.\n\nWanchain uses one time accounts and plans to use ring signatures to protect anonymity and fungibility in the network. Privacy can be provided for simple transactions (sending tokens from one wallet to another) and more complex operations with smart contracts and cross-chain requirements. \n\nIn Wanchain, every account has a main account that contains sub-accounts or one-time accounts. When a sender initiates a private transaction, they create a unique account for the recipient based on their public key. The sender sends the money to this one-time account instead of the public address. The recipient can then use their private key to access all their onetime accounts.\n\nRing signatures are a type of digital signature in which a group of possible signers are merged to produce a group signature. The sent transaction is mixed with a series of past transactions that act as a decoy, to prevent anyone from identifying the actual sender. Ring signatures obfuscate the sender while one time accounts\nobfuscate the receiver.\n","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":null,"onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":"Third-party

 ledger  is  building  a  platform  where  users  can  contribute  or  consumer  clean  energy    resources  across  the  network.  Pegged  to  local  currencies  and  convertible  to  cash,  the  platform  aims  to  focus  on  individuals  in  high  density  and  urban  environments.  Unlike  centrally managed power systems, these decentralized energy resources are not powered by one  central  provider,  potentially  creating  a  more  competitive  environment  and  preventing  the potential for complete system shut downs. \n\nThe  team  believes  that  by  building  this  blockchain  enabled  peer-to-peer  energy  platform,  they can reinvent energy markets. They intend to have a wide menu of energy applications including ones that can give retailers or users the ability to simply trade electricity with one and another in real time. Long term, the team envisions an application that will allow for shared ownership  of  energy  assets  as  well  as  autonomous  energy  agents  that  will  automatically  disperse energy that is acquired. \n\nPower Ledger operates on two blockchain layers and uses two tokens, POWR and Sparkz. The POWR token is an ERC20 token that can operate on the Ethereum network. Sparkz,  on  the  other  hand,  is  purchased  and  redeemed  using  fiat  currencies  within  individual  trading  platforms  that  have  closed-loop  exchanges  for  energy  and Sparkz. In the system, the POWR tokens are the protocol tokens used to access the Power Ledger  platform,  as  well  as  interact  with  the  Sparkz  token  directly.  Sparkz  tokens  are  stable  and  pegged  to  local  currency.  As  the  Sparkz  tokens  are  a  closed  loop  internal  token,  they  can move instantly with banking overheads to allow for timely micro energy transactions. In the future, the team expects that application hosts such as property managers, utilities and retailers will demand the POWR tokens as their platforms grow and they will need the Sparkz to power the platform.

Marketplaces on the network, also known as districts, are built upon a standard open-source framework comprised of Ethereum smart contracts and front-end libraries. Districts provide the core functionalities required to operate an online market or community. Namely, the ability for users to post listings, filter and search through listings, rank peers and amass reputation, and send invoices and collect payments. \n\nThe district0x Network Token (DNT) is used as a means of facilitating open participation and coordination on the network. DNT can be used to signal what districts should be built and deployed by the district0x team and can be staked to gain access to voting rights in any district on the district0x Network.\n\nVoting rights are utilized to come to a consensus on everything ranging from a district’s branding and design decisions, to what functionality is added to the district via auxiliary modules, to the appropriate settings for any adjustable parameters of these modules, to the means in which any revenue collected by a district is to be distributed, and beyond.\n\nCurrently, there are three active districts, Ethlance, Name Bazaar, and Meme Factory:\nEthlance, launched in Jan. 2017, is a first of its kind job market platform for connecting freelancers and developers with employers. Its database runs entirely on the Ethereum public blockchain, and front-end source files are distributed on IPFS. As such, Ethlance is fully decentralized.\nName Bazaar, launched in Oct. 2017, is a peer-to-peer marketplace for the exchange of names registered via the Ethereum Name Service.\nMeme Factory, launched in May 2019, allows users to create and trade provably rare digital assets (typically in the form of memes) on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\ndistrict0x intends to release its District Registry soon, which will replace the current voting system district creation with a community-driven token curated registry (TCR). The registry will allow for on-chain governance within each district as well as governance over the district0x network at large.

Using the District Creation Platform users will be able to customize the parameters of the smart contracts for their district. The team plans to use a modular directory similar to the Apple app store in order to allow for easy discovery and use of districts. \n\nAt the core of the platform is the d0xINFRA framework, which provides the basic infrastructure for a district. The framework provides underlying Ethereum smart contracts and front-end libraries that govern the deployment of new districts and provide baseline functionalities. Each district uses a shared combination of d0xINFRA contracts and district-specific contracts to manage backend functionality. A similar model is used for front-end logic, allowing for flexible UI development. \n\nIn addition to the core functionalities, the team plans to use auxiliary modules that can add further features. These modules can be developed by third-parties which charge a fee for use of their product. Districts will decide on a district-by-district basis what auxiliary modules are implemented via their \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/governance\"\u003egovernance\u003c/a\u003e process. \n\nDistrict0x plans to integrate governance on both the district and network-wide levels using Aragon once the platform is launched and able to be integrated. The creation of a district on the district0x network would trigger the creation of a deposit pool and corresponding entity on the Aragon network. This entity will allow for things like management of voting rights, role assignments, and accounting functionalities.

Once launched, the District Registry will replace the pseudo-on-chain voting system currently for district creation with a community-driven token curated registry (TCR). The registry will allow for on-chain governance within each district as well as governance over the district0x network at large.\n\nAn interim step before full on-chain governance implementation will be the district0x Tasp App. The Task App will list all tasks fundamental to the district0x roadmap including everything from design work, to marketing, to development, and allow for 3rd party service providers to bid on these individual tasks.","onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":"Direct On-Chain Vote","onchain_governance_details":"The district0x project is pursuing a full on-chain governance system.

In order to apply for inclusion, districts will be required to submit a proposal for their district and send district0x network tokens (DNT) to the registry smart contract as a deposit. If an application goes unchallenged, meaning there are no objections to inclusion, the district will be created and an Aragon entity will be established. The original deposit will be sent to this entity to establish voting rights for the district.\n\n__District Registry challenges__\nIf the district is challenged, a vote will occur during which time token holders can vote whether or not to include the new entity. In order to challenge an application, a token holder would be required to stake DNT equal to the amount deposited by the applicant. If voters decide not to include a new district, the applicant forfeits their tokens, which will be distributed to the voters that voted for the winning side (e.g. the side that voted not to include). If a challenge fails, and the district is accepted, the challenger will forfeit their deposit.","is_treasury_decentralized":null},"grants":[]},"metadata":{"updated_at":"2021-02-17T19:48:29Z"}}},{"id":"6104fc11-c09f-467b-bb70-f5017483f864","symbol":"LOOM","name":"Loom

Over the next two years, the team worked to build Syscoin 2.0, which it eventually launched in May 2016.\n\nThe launch of the 2.0 network included a new graphical interface and wallet, replacing the previous command line interface. In Aug. 2017, the Syscoin team created Blockchain Foundry as a separate entity to help realize its goal of creating a marketplace platform. In Sept. 2017, Blockchain Foundry released its first product Blockmarket, a blockchain-based e-commerce solution. Following the successful launch of Blockmarket, Blockchain Foundry raised $3.3 million to fund its operations, which included research and development for various blockchain innovations outside of Syscoin.\n\nOn April 30, 2018, Syscoin released another upgrade to the network (3.0), which includes the ability to create unique fungible and non-fungible tokens on top of the blockchain. Syscoin 4.0, its latest upgrade, involves a number of changes including: Z-DAG - a decentralized DAG for assets which features global sorting of DAG consensus and near-instant transactions, with SHA256 finality also achieved in background and Bridge - cross-chain asset interoperability without requiring atomic swap nor intermediaries, that offers scalability to Ethereum and other platforms, giving ERC20's, etc, the option to utilize Z-DAG for simple value transfers/micro-transactions.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Syscoin 1.0","date":"2014-08-16T04:00:00Z","type":"Network Launch","details":"Syscoin 1.0 market the network launch of Syscoin, which included a command-line version of its decentralized marketplace as well as certificates and aliases."},{"title":"Syscoin 2.0","date":"2016-05-21T04:00:00Z","type":"Network Change","details":"The second Syscoin node release introduced blockchain pruning (to optimize the storage requirements), network-specific identities, and Z-cash-like private payments, among other new features.

The Syscoin team says merge-mining provides a more robust and secure blockchain environment and \"reduces network vulnerabilities that might allow exploits such as a 51% attack.\"\n\nMasternodes\nDuring an update on April 30, 2018, the team announced the integration of “masternodes” on the network. To ensure the ledger is fully synchronized real-time and transactions are relayed efficiently at high volumes. Masternodes will also be responsible for future governance decisions in the network, like voting on upgrade proposals. To participate as a masternode, users are required to stake a specific amount of SYS tokens.

Syscoin Masternode owners benefit from scheduled seniority bonuses in addition to standard block rewards\n\nZDAG technology\nSyscoin uses a transaction framework though which users can determine their optimal means of transfer based on the nature of their transaction (micro or macro). This patent-pending technology is called ZDAG (https://syscoin.org/zdagsyscoinwhitepaper.pdf) and it aims to enable ideal microtransactions that provide probabilistic security (99.9999% detection of double-spends) and global consensus for token transfers -- though it does entail a security trade-off versus Proof-of-Work (PoW) systems. After a short period of time, ZDAG gives way to PoW to ensure long term settlement assurances. If the tradeoff is undesirable, users transferring high value can also opt to rely exclusively on the Proof of Work base layer, which operates at a block time averaging 60 seconds.\n\nSyscoin Bridge\nThis project also supports interoperability through the Syscoin Bridge. This technology does not involve counterparties nor collateralized custodians holding user funds in an attempt to eliminate the risks and limitations commonly associated with cross-chain interoperability. Integration efforts are currently focused on establishing a bi-directional Bridge with Ethereum by means of dual-contract 2WP (two-way peg). In the case of Ethereum, ERC-20 tokens are enabled to utilize the Syscoin Token Platform with ZDAG for fast, low-cost microtransactions. Additionally, this could help address some of the scalability concerns surrounding the Ethereum network; offloading standard token transfers to Syscoin Network enables Ethereum Network to better-perform its flag-ship functionality, Turing-complete smart contract execution. Likewise, Syscoin Platform Tokens are enabled with Ethereum's smart contract capabilities and toolkits.\n","client_repositories":[{"name":"Syscoin","link":"https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin","license_type":"MIT"}]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"ZDAG Practical Performance Analysis","date":"0219-05-22T04:56:02Z","type":null,"details":"Summary of conclusion from auditor Whiteblock: \"Overall, the Z-DAG implementation provided a higher amount of transactional throughput without sacrificing a significant degree of resilience and reliability to adverse network effects\"\n\nSee more details [here](https://www.whiteblock.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ZDAG-Analysis.pdf)"},{"title":"Bug and vulnerability probing against pre-release Syscoin Bridge testnet","date":"2019-07-01T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Bounty-funded probing against Syscoin Bridge testnet has been effective, resulting in a few vulnerabilities being discovered and fixed.

As fees and short-term loan costs for invoice payment processing grow, the Populous team plans to leverage the transparency of a distributed block chain ledger to improve the trail from service to invoice to payment with reduced costs via on-chain smart contracts. Populous also is creating their own in-house credit rating system using Exstensible Business Reporting Language and the Altman Z-Score Formula. \n\nPopulous believes increasingly secure, sophisticated smart contracts can facilitate less asymmetric service-payment exchange that currently imposes material costs on small businesses via three different actors: administrators, invoice sellers, and invoice buyers.

Streamr technology is a core service layer which implements an open-source and vendor-neutral publish/subscribe (pub-sub) protocol for transmission of any kind of real-time data. The data travels via a global peer-to-peer network which is scalable, robust, permissionless, and secured by a cryptographic ledger. Streamr protocol enables a data economy where humans, AI, and connected machines and applications can share access to data and monetize it openly, fairly, and transparently.\n\nIncorporated in 2017 and based in Zug, Switzerland, Streamr Network AG is the corporate entity which coordinates the implementation of the protocol. Core team members have a background in coding, software entrepreneurship and finance. Streamr is a distributed open-source software project with contributors in a range of timezones globally.\n\nAs for background, there are two major problems with the existing data infrastructure: Scalability and the lack of neutrality. The amount of real-time data is increasing exponentially with the growth of IoT and the ubiquity of connected devices. There will come a point where centralized transmission networks are unable to cope with the quantity of the data. Furthermore, the existing services — each controlled by a large commercial entity — are prone to having a single point of failure and necessitate trust and vendor lock-in.\n\nStreamr solves the scalability issue of broadcast messaging protocols by using a peer-to-peer (P2P) network architecture. Technically, you might think of it as BitTorrent for real-time data streams instead of static files. The throughput capacity of the network scales linearly as the number of nodes in the network increases. Because the data packets are routed from the data producer to the data consumer by several routes, the network is resilient to attacks and fault tolerant. \n\nA decentralized network will not emerge without economic incentives for node operators. Streamr aims to solve the incentive problem by using cryptocurrency, cryptographic proofs, and game theory to incentivize people and organisations to run nodes (known as “brokers”) in the network. The end goal is a self-sustainable network which does not need any central party or company to control its operations.\n\nStreamr DATAcoin, or DATA, is the cryptographic token representing value in the Streamr ecosystem, implemented as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. The companion blockchain is used for value settlement, identity, and permission control, while the actual data transmission is handled by the scalable Streamr Network.\n\nBroker nodes contribute bandwidth and storage to the network, and earn DATA paid as usage fees. Running a broker node is somewhat comparable to mining, but instead of solving an CPU/GPU-bound artificial problem and wasting energy, nodes provide useful network resources which, using the Streamr protocol, collectively produce the message transport service.\n\nThe network is decentralized by virtue of the P2P structure and the incentive mechanism. The network is robust and scalable, and it can operate without any central party (not even Streamr) controlling the data or retaining the added value. \n\nStreamr Marketplace and Core are applications made possible and powered by the Network. The Marketplace is a single common interface which brings buyers and sellers of real-time data together. Using a one-to-many off-chain payment scaling solution Monoplasma, the Marketplace also enables crowdselling: large groups of people (say, owners of a connected gadget such as a smartphone) can pool the data they produce into a single product, a Data Union, and get automatically compensated for each purchase of that data. Streamr Core is a toolkit which helps users manage their Streamr resources, explore data, and build integrations and analytics.\nThe Streamr project consists of several layered technologies. As described in the whitepaper, there is a well-defined roadmap on how to implement the full technology stack. The roadmap is divided into three milestones (M1-M3). Each milestone iteratively brings new features into the stack, and is expected to take a year or more to complete.\nThe road towards full decentralization is incremental. Milestone 1 (i.e. the current one) is named Corea. It implements the first version of the P2P network with distributed message brokering functionality, and it already transports around ten billion data points monthly. In Corea, all nodes are still run by Streamr contributors. By Brubeck, trusted parties can join. In the final milestone (Tatum), anyone can run a node.\n\n","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Monk (initial version)","date":"2017-07-31T04:00:00Z","type":"Mainnet","details":"This is a placeholder non-P2P network built around an Apache Kafka -based data pipeline.

It acts as a decentralized message broker, and enables applications and devices such as IoT sensors, connected cars, and “smart” gadgets to make available the data they are producing, as well as listen to incoming data from other applications and devices.\n\nTraditionally, such message brokering has been done by centralized cloud services, leading to vendor lock-in, compromised data confidentiality, and a requirement of trust. The Streamr Network relies on cryptography instead of trust to keep data confidential and to prove its origin, making the network neutral, open, permissionless, and secure.\n\nThe network employs the publish/subscribe pattern. Messages published to a stream (also known as a topic) get delivered to all subscribers listening on that stream in real-time. The network is flexible enough to support many-to-many message brokering, as well as one-to-many, many-to-one, and one-to-one. The network can scale to millions of messages per second, in millions of individual streams.\n\nThe Streamr Network consists of nodes called Brokers. Brokers interconnect to form P2P message passing topologies to produce the pub/sub messaging service.\n\nThe Streamr Network operates alongside the Ethereum blockchain as a companion network. Ethereum accounts are used as identities on Streamr, and data payloads are signed with an Ethereum private key. While the data never gets written to the blockchain, this shared cryptography allows the network to interoperate well with Ethereum, using it for value transfer and as a registry of resources and permissions.\n\nStreamr DATAcoin, or DATA, is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. The token will be used on the Network layer for the node reward mechanism, staking, and reputation. It can also be used as a means of payment on the Streamr Marketplace and on Streamr Core. \n\nStreamr Network can readily be integrated to various data sources and applications via SDKs or directly via the API. SDKs are available for various languages such as JS, Java, and Python. There are also integrations to popular integration and analytics tools such as NodeRED, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink.\n\nIn addition to the Streamr Network itself, the Streamr team has built a number of applications and frameworks that enable the application of the technology for particular use cases. These include the Marketplace application for data monetization, the Ethereum layer 2 scaling solution Monoplasma for scalable revenue sharing, Streamr Core for building integrations and analytics and the Data Unions framework for crowd selling user data. Using the Monoplasma technology Data Unions make it possible that, for the first time, people who produce data can be directly remunerated in a scalable way.","client_repositories":[{"name":"Github Repo","link":"https://github.com/streamr-dev","license_type":"AGPLv3"}]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"Smart contract audit","date":null,"type":null,"details":"[https://s3.amazonaws.com/streamr-public/audits/Token+and+crowd+contribution+contracts+audit.pdf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/streamr-public/audits/Token+and+crowd+contribution+contracts+audit.pdf)"},{"title":"Monoplasma aduit","date":null,"type":null,"details":"Certik conducted a code review of Streamr’s Monoplasma (off-chain solution for scalable revenue sharing) with its full solidity inheritance chain.

There is an annual general meeting, and there is a board of directors in place.\n\nWhile the corporate structure was deemed best for efficient and timely governance of the project in its early years, the Streamr team recognizes that a different governance model is eventually needed. The integral part of Streamr vision is the persistence of Streamr Network as an entity which is not controlled by any central agent, not even the Streamr team.\n\nThe project is at present researching different decision making and resource allocation models. The community will be involved in the process of decentralizing the governance as the roadmap progresses towards a genuinely decentralised peer-to-peer network.\n","onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":null,"onchain_governance_details":null,"is_treasury_decentralized":null},"grants":[{"funding_organizations":null,"grant_program_details":"The Streamr Community Fund  is a resource which is run by the community and backed by funding from the Streamr project.

Metal uses the public Ethereum blockchain. Metal aims to be blockchain agnostic and recognizes the need for multiple cryptocurrencies. If cryptocurrency adoption is to take off it must utilize multiple blockchains. For example, many users wish to see the currency in terms of United States Dollars or Euros. For this reason Metal is using financial instruments that will offer stability. Metal recognized the need for Interoperability and Metal will use inter-blockchain exchanges to transfer between multiple cryptocurrencies and cryptoassets.\n\nMeanwhile, loyalty-based tokens that merchants can create will be on the Ethereum network as well as MTL the token. Metal also recognizes the need for privacy-based tokens like DASH, Monero and Zcash, which will also be supported. Bitcoin is the underlying currency powering all transactions and purchases. However, this may change at a later time with sufficient volume to switch to MTL, Ethereum or something different entirely.\n\nMetal also implements a Proof-of-Processed-Payments (PoPP). Proof-of-Processed-Payments (PoPP) acts as a provable way of identifying users and distributing new currency into the system. At the same time, it rewards users who convert fiat currency into cryptocurrency. For this identity-based, volume-dependent distribution network, Metal first identifies a user through a social security number or passport ID with identification software. Second, Metal gets a photograph on file, either a selfie or picture of identifying documents. Third, Metal can link a credit or debit card number in preparation for processing a payment. If no credit/debit card is available, a user can sign up with only an email address and invoice credit/debit/ach accounts into cryptocurrency. Provided all data points check out and the registered name on the identification matches the name on the credit or debit card, Metal initiates a payment using proprietary anti-money-laundering (AML) and anti-fraud technology. The payment typically declines or accepts in under one minute. The pending payment notification shows on the transaction list for the receiver of funds. When the payment is completely settled and the bank transfer or cryptocurrency issued, a portion of the gross amount of the payment is returned in METAL tokens. This is 5% of the volume of the transaction at trading value for MTL in either direction (sender/receiver). As an example, $100 in MTL is sent. It is trading $1/MTL. Both sender and receiver would both receive 5 MTL.","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"Metal Token Contract Code - Zeppelin","date":"2017-06-30T00:00:00Z","type":"Audit Report","details":"No severe security issues were found.

It aims to provide private and public blockchains with a solution that allows them to interoperate, scale, and communicate with any other network. Nuco was founded by a group of ex-Deloitte employees in 2016 to focus on production-ready enterprise blockchain infrastructure. The firm developed a few solutions for the Ethereum blockchain. It formalized the concept of the “Enterprise Ethereum Stack,” leading Nuco to base an early implementation of The OAN on \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\"\u003eEthereum\u003c/a\u003e.\n\nThe OAN initially launched as the Aion project in July 2017 and focused on providing a blockchain-based ecosystem supported by a scalable, private, and interoperable public blockchain network. The team open-sourced the protocol code in March 2018 and launched its mainnet soon after (April 2018). Since its mainnet launch, the project also released the Aion Virtual Machine — a JVM compliant execution environment on a public chain — and established the Aion Foundation with 55 employees across three cities (Toronto, Shanghai, and Barbados).\n\nIn Nov. 2019, the project rebranded to The Open Application Network (OAN) as the team sought a new strategic direction for its blockchain ecosystem. Per the announcement, the new direction is \"focused on establishing a distinct narrative in the traditional software industry\" and \"solving real problems that are understood and actionable today.\" Despite the change, Aion remains the exclusive brand and narrative of the digital asset underpinning the protocol (i.e., The OAN).\n\nLater that same month, The OAN also upgraded its protocol to include a new consensus algorithm, called Unity, which combines elements of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Previously, The OAN, as well as Aion, was exclusively a PoW chain. The project introduced staking to incentivize participation in and engagement with the network. Unity also led The OAN to shift the economics of Aion issuance by increasing the block reward to compensate both stakers and miners for deploying resources to the network","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Technical Paper Published","date":"2017-07-13T04:00:00Z","type":"Documentation","details":"Introduction to the Aion Network and in-depth exploration of blockchain interoperability"},{"title":"Token Generation Event","date":"2017-09-01T04:00:00Z","type":"Fundraising","details":"Phased approach from Private Sale to Public Pre-Sale.

The intent prior to the cancelation of the public sale was for any leftover tokens from all sale rounds to be allocated to the TRS redistribution pool.\n\nThe public TRS was allocated 120 million tokens, which in addition to the amount contributed to the TRS (37 million AION), are being released to token holders who chose to contribute over 12 months, 31.25% of which was distributed in the first month (49 million AION), with a continued release of 6.25% (9.8 million AION) over the remaining 11 months, ending November 15, 2018.\n\nThe private TRS was allocated 120 million tokens, which in addition to the amount contributed to the TRS (186 million AION), are being released to the Aion Foundation and Founding Partners evenly over 36 months at a rate of 2.8% per month (8.6 million AION), ending November 15, 2020."},"fundraising":{"sales_rounds":[{"title":"Token Sale (USD)","start_date":"2017-09-01T16:00:00Z","type":"Private","details":null,"end_date":"2017-09-25T16:00:00Z","native_tokens_allocated":5596776,"asset_collected":"USD","price_per_token_in_asset":null,"equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd":0.5,"amount_collected_in_asset":null,"amount_collected_in_usd":2798388,"is_kyc_required":null,"restricted_jurisdictions":null},{"title":"Token Sale (ETH)","start_date":"2017-09-01T16:00:00Z","type":"Private","details":null,"end_date":"2017-09-25T16:00:00Z","native_tokens_allocated":19969005.84795,"asset_collected":"ETH","price_per_token_in_asset":0.00171,"equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd":0.5,"amount_collected_in_asset":34147,"amount_collected_in_usd":9984502.92,"is_kyc_required":null,"restricted_jurisdictions":null},{"title":"Token Sale (BTC)","start_date":"2017-09-01T16:00:00Z","type":"Private","details":null,"end_date":"2017-09-25T16:00:00Z","native_tokens_allocated":5683333.3333,"asset_collected":"BTC","price_per_token_in_asset":0.00012,"equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd":0.5,"amount_collected_in_asset":682,"amount_collected_in_usd":2841666.67,"is_kyc_required":null,"restricted_jurisdictions":null},{"title":"Pre-Sale","start_date":"2017-10-03T16:00:00Z","type":"Public","details":null,"end_date":"2017-10-10T16:00:00Z","native_tokens_allocated":10000000,"asset_collected":"ETH","price_per_token_in_asset":null,"equivalent_price_per_token_in_usd":0.88,"amount_collected_in_asset":24220,"amount_collected_in_usd":8800000,"is_kyc_required":null,"restricted_jurisdictions":null}],"sales_documents":[{"name":"White Paper","link":"https://aion.network/media/en-aion-network-technical-introduction.pdf"}],"sales_treasury_accounts":[],"treasury_policies":null,"projected_use_of_sales_proceeds":[{"category":"Compensation","amount_in_percentage":55},{"category":"Marketing \u0026 Ecosystem","amount_in_percentage":10},{"category":"Professional Services","amount_in_percentage":15},{"category":"G\u0026A","amount_in_percentage":20}]},"initial_distribution":{"initial_supply":465934587,"initial_supply_repartition":{"allocated_to_investors_percentage":11.7,"allocated_to_organization_or_founders_percentage":71.5,"allocated_to_premined_rewards_or_airdrops_percentage":null},"token_distribution_date":null,"genesis_block_date":"2018-04-24T08:00:00Z"}},"consensus_and_emission":{"supply":{"supply_curve_details":"In Nov. 2018, The OAN shifted the economics of AION issuance due to the introduction of Unity, the network's new consensus protocol that combines elements of Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS).

PoSV is designed to facilitate faster, smoother exchange of coins between network participants, a useful feature for social media platform interfacing. PoSV also relies on the monetary theory that higher currency velocity causes a stronger economic market. For Reddcoin, PoS too heavily incentivizes hoarding and PoW restricts the monetary supply (ergo circulation) too severely. High stake velocity is a signal that Reddcoin's goals for the protocol are being met. \n\nPoSV does borrow from PoS in that forking is very difficult, at least. Reddcoin references forking in terms of \"cloning\", and cloning a protocol would confuse users, according to Reddcoin.

Waltonchain Foundation initiated the project in November, 2016 and the main net launched March 31, 2018. The project is named after Charlie Walton, the inventor of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology and is also an acronym for Wisdom Alters Label Trade Organization Network. Waltonchain uses RFID to track products along the supply chain and store the accompanying data in a trust reduced public ledger. Waltonchain competes with another Chinese company, VeChain, that is looking to solve similar issues in supply chain management. \n\nWaltonchain uses an ERC-20 token WTC, that is used to create side chains, provide dividend interest and to operate as a credit instrument. These side chains can operate independently of the main chain with their own consensus mechanism to improve scalability while retaining security of the main chain. Dividends are paid to Masternodes whose main function is to validate transactions, secure the network and enable governance mechanisms. In order to operate a masternode, 5,000 WTC are needed to be posted as collateral to disincentives attacking the network. In addition to regular masternodes, there are Guardian Masternodes that provide proof-of-work to the system and then share the rewards from a separate pool of token rewards. The amount of WTC distributed to these masternodes is a function of the amount of work that is contributed, and there is a maximum of 15 Guardian Masternodes on the network. Waltonchain foundation also recruited 99 Super Master Nodes worldwide to “mobilize the global community for incubation and selection of high quality child chains.” The Foundation invested 10 million WTC to establish the Waltonchain Global Ecosystem Incubation Fund to be used for child chain incubation and Super Master Node recruiting.

PoS and PoW function as sybil control mechanisms and prevent the risk of 51% attacks. Proof of Labor is a new consensus mechanism for data transmission and token exchange between various parent chain, child chain and cross-child-chain nodes on the Waltonchain network. This cross-chain data transmission is the extraction of hashes based on data features and storage on the parent chain making it convenient to search for and authenticate data in the Waltonchain network in the future. In addition, cross-chain token exchange occurs via a ledger based on atomic swaps and records every transaction between child chains and the parent chain. \n\nThe smart contract language supported by Waltonchain is Turing complete which facilitates complex business logic and applications. However, since smart contracts will run constantly and independently on all nodes, it is expensive in terms of both computation and storage. To solve this, the Waltonchain Foundation set up the unique Data Pattern for Smart Contracts which keeps the logic simple, reduces Gas consumption, standardizes operations and provides output data in standard formats (e.g. Json). They also designed and built a number of smart contract libraries where smart contracts can be queried, invoked, and reused via the event function index. After obtaining the relevant standard data file, data interaction between an application and other child chain systems can be achieved.

JLRDA tokens were used as non-tradable proofs of ownership during the sale, which were redeemed 1:1 for actual IGNIS tokens on 1 January 2018 when the Ardor platform’s mainnet went live. \n\nAt the close of the crowd-sale, 261,194,254.50 JLRDA tokens had sold for a total of 167 million NXT (~ US$15 million). Jelurida kept 20% of these funds in NXT and sold the remaining 80% for Bitcoin and fiat currencies. The remaining 261,694,254.50 JLRDA from the crowd-sale were redeemed for the equivalent IGNIS by Jelurida and kept to fund future operations. As of 13 February 2019, Jelurida held 236,000,000.90 IGNIS.   \n\nIn addition to the crowd-sale, 499,449,964 IGNIS tokens were airdropped to Nxt account holders on a 0.5 IGNIS to 1 NXT ratio based on an account snapshot that occurred on 28 December 2017 at Nxt block height 1636363.\n","general_emission_type":null,"precise_emission_type":null,"is_capped_supply":null,"max_supply":null},"consensus":{"consensus_details":null,"general_consensus_mechanism":"n/a","precise_consensus_mechanism":null,"targeted_block_time":null,"block_reward":null,"mining_algorithm":"n/a","next_halving_date":null,"is_victim_of_51_percent_attack":null}},"native_treasury":{"accounts":[],"treasury_usage_details":null}},"technology":{"overview":{"technology_details":"The advanced features and functionality available on the time-tested Nxt blockchain were implemented on the public and permissionless Ignis child chain when it launched as the core child chain of the Ardor platform on 01 January 2018. Ignis offers lightweight smart contracts coded in Java and 250+ APIs, making it simple for anyone to tokenize supply chains, launch dApps, manage KYC/AML compliant STOs, and run blockchain based services that interface seamlessly with off-chain databases. \n\nIgnis transactions are “bundled” and validated by the Ardor parent chain’s energy efficient proof of stake consensus. Bundlers can be run by anyone and they are nodes that collect transaction fees in the native child chain token, IGNIS, while paying with ARDR tokens to send the child chain transactions for validation on the parent chain. Five custom bundler templates are built-in to the platform to enable app and service owners to sponsor the transaction fees for only their intended end-users, eliminating the need for users to directly interface with the blockchain. Ignis is interoperable with all other child chains on the Ardor platform. \n\nThe Ignis chain offers powerful features such as issuing and trading digital assets and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on the built-in decentralized exchange, launching voting systems, app creation through arbitrary messaging, sending private transactions, and a data cloud. The potential use cases of these features are further expanded by revolutionary offerings such as secure transaction vouchers, account and asset controls, asset properties, and composite phased transactions.","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":null,"onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":"Direct

zero-knowledge proofs which allows users to destroy coins and then redeem them later for brand new ones with no transaction history.\n\nIts research created the Lelantus privacy protocol which supports high anonymity sets without requiring trusted setup and relying only on standard cryptographic assumptions. Lelantus' innovation in combining one-out-of-many proofs with hidden amounts have also been used in Monero's Triptych protocol and Beam's Lelantus-MW. Firo also utilises Dandelion++ to obscure the originating IP of transactions without relying on a external services such as Tor/i2P.\n\nFiro developed and utilizes Merkle Tree Proofs (MTP) as its Proof-of-Work algorithm which aims to be memory hard with fast verification to encourage mining using commodity hardware. The blockchain is also further secured with LLMQ ChainLocks. The Firo blockchain was used in the Thai Democrat Party Elections in 2018 to elect its party leader with over 127,000+ votes cast

One of Hxro’s unique attributes is that its core products are parimutuel, meaning they aggregate all positions into a liquidity pool with winners (in-the-money positions) sharing the pool at expiration. This creates a wide array of payoff possibilities for the user base.\n\nThe team believes both traditional and crypto trading venues lack the ability to provide users a welcoming and well-rounded experience. The mission is to improve this experience by applying game and meta-game layers to our platform as a way to soften some of the sharp edges that are historically presented by early crypto derivatives exchanges.\n\nHxro launched in January 2019 with its flagship product, MoonRekt. Along with enhancing the MoonRekt product offering, they plan to expand the platform's global opportunity set to more products designed to provide users an easier and more digestible way to interact with the market.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Platform Beta ","date":"2019-01-01T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":null},{"title":"Minimum Viable Product","date":"2019-01-01T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Launch of first Product - 5 minute MoonRekt"},{"title":"Bitcoin Integration","date":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"HXRO integrated BTC denominated contracts"},{"title":"Lightning Wallet Integration","date":"2019-11-01T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":null},{"title":"Hxro API Developer Hub","date":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Allow Users to access WebSocket API for data and order entry"},{"title":"Hxro 2.0 ","date":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"HXR released a new UI and system release"},{"title":"Liquidity Producer Pool","date":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"HXRO launched a new incentive and staking rewards model, bringing on various liquidity providers such as Alameda Research, CMS Holdings, Arca Funds, and Three Arrows Capital"}],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[{"slug":"daniel-taylor","first_name":"Daniel","last_name":"Taylor","title":"Director of Operations at Hxro Games, Ltd.","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1587600000%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DIhdfCX2CdUeHYXGxY_ihvCSSIjxdJQ_qddCZQcLyjAo"},{"slug":"jason-ayala","first_name":"Jason","last_name":"Ayala","title":"Senior Software Engineer at Hxro Games","description":null,"avatar_url":null},{"slug":"kevin-steele","first_name":"Kevin","last_name":"Steele","title":"Community Strategist at Hxro Games, Inc.","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1587600000%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3D9dhYNofwZQfnM_A7y479Z5dR5MVycPbm5Zd9nhpoMP0"},{"slug":"dan-gunsberg","first_name":"Dan","last_name":"Gunsberg","title":"Co-Founder and CEO of Hxro Games","description":"Co-Founder and CEO of Hxro Games.

A small percentage of each block reward goes to PIVX's self-governance budget. Reward remainders are split between a master node and the staked network participant.

Their sole mandate was to develop Melon, an asset management computer built on Ethereum. In February 2017, the company raised money through a token sale to fund development. \n\nThe team sees an increasingly wide range of asset classes becoming tokenized in the future and therefore sees Melon not just as a crypto investment management tool, but the infrastructure for cross-asset class investment management 3.0 of the future. Melonport AG delivered v1.0 of the Melon protocol in February 2019, and will subsequently wind down, handing control over to the Melon Council DAO, currently running on aragonOS. \n\nThe Melon protocol aims to enable participants to set up, manage, and invest in funds of digital assets in an open, competitive, transparent and decentralized way. Melon allows asset managers to create their own tokenized investment vehicles and define the key parameters (including fee structure, trading exchanges, asset universe, risk management, investors), which are in turn deployed to the blockchain and enforced by smart contracts, as opposed to being written in a fund prospectus and operated and controlled by intermediaries. Investors are thereby assured that the pooled digital assets will be managed and administered exactly as specified in the setup of the on-chain investment vehicle. This optimizes current processes in fund management to a large extent which leads to cost, time and operational savings. \n\nMelon differentiates itself from other asset management protocols by being the first decentralized infrastructure of its kind and by allowing investors to keep control of their private keys enabling them to maintain custody of their own assets at all times. More specifically, Melon opens up the following opportunities:\nUnlocks a wide variety of Web3 native use cases (eg. DAO treasury management, staking funds, prediction fund, crypto-kittie collectible fund, etc, etc)  \nAnyone, anywhere can set up an on-chain track record and build somewhat of a “CV” on-chain  \nEnables people to monetize their talent through management and performance fees \nLowers barriers to entry, giving investors access to a wide range of transparent investment opportunities (funds).  \nCreation and management of Web3 native investment vehicles (eg. Melon for the back and middle office, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/decentralized-exchanges\"\u003edecentralized exchanges\u003c/a\u003e for trading venues, \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/organization/compound\"\u003eCompound \u003c/a\u003eand others for lending/borrowing, and \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/numeraire\"\u003eNumerai\u003c/a\u003e for information sourcing)  \nOn-chain risk management helps prevent the “bad behavior” in asset management  \nSmart contract level integration with DeFi to ideally become a one-stop shop protocol for everything DeFi.

On the other side, tokens are burnt when setting up a fund, requesting investment and redeeming assets.\n\nWhen users interact with an amgu (asset management gas unit) payable function on the Melon protocol, they pay asset management gas in ETH to the Melon network. The total asset management gas paid is equal to:\n  Number of amgu consumed  amgu price\nThe ETH paid for amgu* fees by users is then sent to the Melon Engine. The Melon Engine contract sells ETH and buys MLN at the engine price. The engine price includes a premium over the ETH/MLN market price (market price is retrieved through \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/asset/kyber-network#profile\"\u003eKyber network\u003c/a\u003e). The MLN bought through the Melon Engine is instantly burnt. \n\nThe amgu price can be adjusted when necessary by the Melon Council DAO, in case of a massive network usage spike or period of extreme volatility on MLN/USD. The idea is to keep the Melon gas price at competitive levels compared to other asset management alternatives. \n\nIt also offers the Melon Council DAO the ability to control the supply dynamics of MLN. Indeed, the amount of MLN burned is directly correlated to the number of amgu consumed and the amgu price. As such, periods with high activity will lead to an increasing number of MLN burnt. In case the deflation rate is too high, the Melon Council DAO can adjust down the amgu price. \n\nThe supply curve was drawn to reflect this burn \u0026 mint mechanism. Several hypotheses were taken into account:\nA growing number of funds managed on the Melon Protocol, especially in the first 10 years. From 1,000 funds in 2020 to 20,000 in 2026, 40,000 in 2033 and 59,000 in 2050.\nA fluctuating amgu price throughout the years, fixed at a low level in the first two years (0.0000005 MLN) to incentivize usage, and raised during the subsequent years (0.000002) before slowly declining to reduce the deflation rate (0.000001).\nTo go further, the Melonomics blog posts provide a comprehensive deep-dive on MLN economics.

A collection of Melon fund smart-contracts are responsible for asset custody, NAV (Net Asset Value) calculations, performance, fee accounting, distributions, fund creation, redemptions, and trade execution. A Melon Fund is controlled by its Manager and bound by the pre-defined set of rules (embedded in smart-contracts) dictating how, and in what way the assigned Manager can invest. The Manager can place or take orders on the different decentralized exchanges integrated, and can claim their management/performance fees at any time. A Melon Fund may or may not only be open to whitelisted investors (at the discretion of the Manager); if it is, the Melon Fund is capable of attributing shares to addresses investing in the fund. The investors can invest in a Melon Fund and can redeem their shares from a Melon fund. \n\nFor better accessibility, users are able to interact with the smart contracts by downloading and locally running the Melon Manager interface for managing and investing in funds. It is also possible for anyone to create their own interface to the Melon smart contracts and white-label it. Melon features a web interface where investors can search and rank various investment funds by metrics like performance and assets under management (AUM) as well as a desktop application (Melon Manager Interface) that allows asset managers to run their fund’s operations securely. Each fund has its own front page with important details like date of inception, AUM, NAV, historical performance, description of the strategy, fee structure, and historical volatility. In addition, managers can generate custom reports, factsheets, reporting documents directly from their front page. \n\nWhen a Manager creates a fund, they have to define a certain number of optional parameters: - Asset universe (assets the fund is allowed to trade and hold) - Fee structure (management and performance fee) - Exchanges the fund will be allowed to trade with - Risk management rule set (eg. max number of positions, max position size, etc) - Investor compliance (KYC and other requirements) \n\nOnce the parameters are chosen, the fund contract is deployed to the Ethereum network and has its own fund address. From that moment onwards, the fund can only behave as pre-specified. The rules specified by the contracts act like a fund prospectus, but instead of having auditors, accountants, fund administrators check and enforce those rules, the rules are enforced by the blockchain. This aims to reduce overhead and increase investor assurances. Managers can trade on decentralized exchanges that have been integrated with the Melon protocol, so far these include; OasisDex, various 0x relayers and Kyber Network have already been integrated.\n","client_repositories":[{"name":"Melon Protocol Implementation","link":"https://github.com/melonproject/protocol","license_type":"MIT"}]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"First Audit","date":null,"type":null,"details":"Not Public"},{"title":"Second Audit","date":null,"type":null,"details":"Not Public"},{"title":"Third Audit","date":null,"type":null,"details":"Not Public"},{"title":"Fourth Audit","date":"2018-05-11T04:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Audit report was [prepared ](https://github.com/solidified-platform/audits/blob/master/Audit%20Report%20-%20Melon%20Competition%20%5B05.11.18%5D.pdf)by Solidified for Melonport covering the competition and price feed contracts"},{"title":"Fifth Audit","date":null,"type":null,"details":"Ongoing, will be made public before main net release "}],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":"After two years of development, Melonport AG handed off governance of the protocol to the Melon Council, a \u003ca href=\"https://messari.io/resource/dao\"\u003eDecentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)\u003c/a\u003e comprised of two parts: the Melon Technical Council (MTC) and the Melon Exposed Business (MEB) representatives. \n\nMTC is initially appointed by the Melonport AG team and will grow by a two-thirds majority vote of the Melon council.

Instead of framing its value proposition as a cryptocurrency payment card, it is framing it more along the lines of a complete payment experience. Compared to many legacy payment cards with large currency conversion fees, Crypto.com will give all its customers perfect interbank exchange rates regardless of which currency is used. This is made possible by the low overhead required to manage the payment infrastructure as most of the work is outsourced to bitcoin and ethereum. \n\nCrypto.com offers 5 different products:\n\nMCO Visa Cards are range of Visa approved prepaid cards with a range of benefits including a selection of metal cards with no annual/monthly/delivery fees, up to 5% cash back (paid in MCO), unlimited airport lounge access, 100% rebates on Spotify and Netflix subscriptions, 10% back on Airbnb and Expedia purchases. Further, it offers interbank rates (the Google rate) on Forex and no fee ATM withdrawals based on the tier of card. To reserve a metal card, users purchase and hold MCO tokens for 6 months in the Crypto.com Wallet \u0026 Card App.\n\nCrypto.com Wallet offers users the ability to securely buy, exchange, sell, and send a growing range of crypto currencies at true costs - no fees, no markups. \n\nCrypto Invest allows a user to purchase one of three portfolios of crypto which is traded using quant trading strategies (market signals) and designed to perform in any market. No entrance, exit or management fees. Only a success fee: 9% of profits (with MCO staked) or 18% (without MCO staked). Set up is just a few taps and starts with a little as $20 USD.\n\nCrypto Credit (not yet launched) is a crypto collateralized loan service which allows users to \"Spend Crypto without Spending.\" A user deposits crypto in the Crypto Credit and receives a line of credit in stablecoin - PAX or TUSD which can be used to top up the MCO Visa Card. There is no credit check conducted and repayment can be made over 12 -months. Users with MCO staked enjoy preferential APRs.\n\nCrypto Earn (not yet launched) allows users to deposit their crypto and earn interest. Initially with 1 and 3 month terms, with a flexible holding term coming soon. Users that have MCO staked earn at preferred rates.","issuing_organizations":[{"slug":"mco-technology-gmbh","name":"MCO Technology GmbH","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/crypto.com-mco-logo.png","description":null}]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Incubation","date":"2016-05-31T22:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Founded Crypto.com"},{"title":"MCO Visa Card","date":"2016-08-31T22:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Secured Card Issuing Capability"},{"title":"Crypto.com Wallet \u0026 Card App","date":"2016-09-30T22:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Built Prototype"},{"title":"Incubation","date":"2016-10-31T23:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Accepted into the Supercharger, Asia's Leading Fintech Accelerator"},{"title":"Incubation","date":"2017-01-31T23:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Accepted into Hong Kong Government Backed Cyberport Incubation Program"},{"title":"Incubation","date":"2017-03-31T22:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Graduated from SuperCharger, Demo Day at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange"},{"title":"MCO Token Sale","date":"2017-04-30T22:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"Launched Token Sale -

First, safe contract execution needs an assurance that programmatic value transfers will be reliably verified and stored on-chain, which led Aeternity to develop a few languages, including Sophia, and a new virtual machine, FTWVM. In the long run, Aeternity plans to support multiple VMs. \n\nThe second principle is finding a way to execute transactionsefficiently. Aeternity believes this requires implementing state channels to use the main chain only for executing smart contracts, not storing data. It's also the reason behind Aeternity's hybrid proof-of-stake-proof-of-work (PoS/PoW) consensus mechanism. Cost is also a corollary to efficiency for Aeternity, which leaves fee determinations up to miners and users. \n\nThe security of the Aeternity blockchain is maintained by circulating a native token called Aeons (AE). All fees are paid with AE, and the initial distribution of Aeon tokens at the genesis block is controlled by a smart contract hosted on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-20 Aeons are distributed on Ethereum with a built-in burn feature for when smart contracts are executed and tokens are exchanged for Aeternity mainnet tokens for final settlement.

Credit Network (RCN) is a project being developed by Ripio, a blockchain startup in Latin America which originally operated a bitcoin payment platform under the name BitPagos. In Jan. 2017 the company rebranded and took on Ripo, the name of its original wallet service, as the company name. In 2016 BitPagos introduced Ripio Credit which currently allows users to create installment loans using bitcoin. Unlike traditional loans, Ripio Credit does not require users to possess a credit card or bank account.\n\nRCN was created to decentralize the lending process by leveraging a series of smart contracts and the existing Ripio credit application. In the RCN network borrowers and lenders are matched through a custom smart contract. Third-party services are used to verify a borrowers identity and a credit score can be generated by a scoring agent. To ensure that lenders are protected in the case of a default co-signers are used to act as guarantors. Co-signers are responsible for collecting defaulted payments in accordance with local regulations. \n\nWhile loans can be denominated in local currencies the third-parties in the network like identity providers and scoring agents are required to use the RCN token for exchanging payments. A price oracle is built into the network to provide real-time price details for these agents. This means that in order to participate in the network it is necessary to own RCN tokens. Ripio Credit launched as the initial provider of all services, including wallet provider, scoring agent, id-verifier, co-signer, and credit provider for users in Argentina. \n\n","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[{"title":"Claim Registry ERC939","date":"2019-12-31T05:00:00Z","type":null,"details":"The ERC939 is the teams approach to Identity and Scoring in the RCN Network.

RCN network provides the basic infrastructure for providing loans to users and matching them with lenders. Wallet providers, who wish to offer loans to their users, are able to create custom smart contracts that allow them to specify the terms of a loan, receive funds from lenders, and distribute them to borrowers. When a user provides their information to a wallet application a smart contract is created containing details such as the loan amount, rate, and repayment details before being broadcast to the network. The borrower's information is then verified by an identity provider and a credit score is created by a scoring agent. Co-signers are responsible for establishing the terms under which repayment will be collected and if they sign off on a loan are responsible for collecting defaulted payments.   After a loan has been verified and signed by a co-signer it is listed on a credit exchange for lenders to review. Lenders then have the ability to select loans that they wish to fund.  Because multiple types of currencies will be used within the network Ripio has created an oracle service to provide price information to the smart contracts.\n\nThe Basalt is the last stable version of the RCN protocol it's currently working on the Ethereum mainnet; allows borrowers, lenders, and cosigners to request, lend and pay bullet loans. These loans are configured with an interest rate, a punitive interest rate, a duration, and a first payment date; all the accrued interests are calculated on-chain.","client_repositories":[{"name":"RCN Network GitHub","link":"https://github.com/ripio/rcn-network","license_type":null}]},"security":{"audits":[{"title":"V1 Contracts

The platform also operates a serverless model, where all users are required to host and run smart contracts through Amazon Web Services. \n\nDragonchain introduces the concept of context-based verification as its consensus mechanism. The platform operates through two subsets, commercial and open-source, giving users a choice on the level of security they wish to use. Overall the architecture is better described as a “blockchain of blockchains” with five different levels of consensus available depending on how a user wishes to process transactions. The higher the consensus level the more secure a transaction should be. \n\nThe five levels of consensus defined by Dragonchain are: business verification, enterprise verification, network diversity verification, external partner verification, and checkpoint verification. Business verification provides local approval of transactions at the business level. Enterprise verification expands the approval process to the entire network and checks for block and individual transaction validity. Network diversity verification expands on this by ensuring that validations are coming from a sufficiently diverse set of sources. External partner verification has a third party cryptographically sign the records from the previous step.

Bocknet empowers developers to build applications that can pay for certain features on different blockchains through one codebase.\n \nBlocknet also enables direct cross-chain atomic swaps for decentralized exchange. In traditional decentralized exchanges, token pairs are limited to one blockchain. For example, Radar Relay and Paradex can only leverage the Ethereum chain via 0x. This limitation hampers the functionality of all blockchain-based applications and incurs significant waste a la transaction fees across chains.

DHT is a secure protocol used by services like BitTorrent and the Pirate Bay to locate users without requiring the IP addresses of network peers. XBridge enables searching for, locating, and broadcasting between nodes on different blockchains so Blocknet can send transaction information through APIs to more than one blockchain. \n\nXName is a blockchain router, which takes the information throughput of XBridge and applies it to different blockchains in the Block network via an inter-chain address system. XName is still early-stage technology, and the main challenge in developing this system is the tradeoff between cost and truthfulness of lookups performed on different networks. Looking up information on different blockchains requires node involvement for which certain incentives are necessary, and this may increase the cost of doing business on Blocknet. Currently Blocknet mitigate these costs by allowing nodes to bootstrap themselves through a hard-coded query to a trusted provider or by querying their peers on XBridge. But these are temporary solutions since they involve trusted intermediaries.\n \nXChat is the peer-to-peer data transport for Blocknet, which decentralized application (dapps) developers commonly used when building on a particular chain (e.g. Ethereum’s Whisper). XChat allows dapps to perform more complex trustless operations on the blockchain besides simply transferring value. This communication protocol is important to allowing dapps to signal to each other via publish small amounts of information when being used. In essence, XChat is a small end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer chat-room module for dapps running on separate blockchains.

This framework allows users to search through all blockchains for decentralized applications and users, like how Google created the first web search engine. Instead of ranking pages based on how often they were cited, Nebulas ranks people on how ‘valuable’ they are with metrics like how often people are sending transactions and how liquid their supply of funds is.\n\nNebulas also has created a dynamic programming environment equipped to handle future upgrades with considerable ease. Along with their ‘value’ rank, Nebulas incited a self-evolving ecosystem for their blockchain in which their Nebulas Virtual Machine (NVM) and its upgrades are isolated from the node clients. This means that as the NVM is upgraded, there is no responsibility on the part of the wallets, exchanges, or nodes to upgrade their software. This also means that unlike in Ethereum, smart contracts do not need to be changed or supplied with a new version during upgrades. In this way, the NVM is stored in the blockchain itself where the Ethereum Virtual Machine is a standalone entity.\n\nFinally, they have implemented a “Developer Incentive Protocol” which aims to reward developers accurately for participating in their development ecosystem. This is specifically for smart contracts on the Nebulas platform, as opposed to the platform participants. This relies on the user ranking system mentioned above by gauging how many many high-ranking users are interacting with the smart contract.\n\nThe team believes that these principles will allow them to create an ecosystem that is self-fulfilling, in that it can evolve its core value proposition while relying exclusively on monetary incentives, similar to an app store. It will also try and serve as a base layer of operability for the blockchain ecosystem, serving the ‘search’ and ‘rankings’ niches instead of specifically targeting transactions as many blockchains do.\n","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[{"slug":"hitters-xu","first_name":"Hitters","last_name":"Xu","title":"Founder of NEO","description":"Founder of Nebulas, founder of Antshares (NEO), former Director of Ant Financial's Blockchain Platform.","avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1542240000%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DDvanWJYQjtoC7FDEyk2WzwTyNNKS8pVWVe74BCY9H-o"}],"organizations":[]},"advisors":{"individuals":[{"slug":"evan-cheng","first_name":"Evan","last_name":"Cheng","title":"Director of Blockchain Engineering at Facebook","description":"Director of Blockchain Engineering at Facebook","avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1542240000%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DfGssPT2K8nzFQ09ssDqvYnfdaj_rn6BdUjvWy3FqEF8"},{"slug":"edith-yeung","first_name":"Edith ","last_name":"Yeung","title":"Investor and Project Advisor","description":"Investor and Project Advisor","avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1551916800%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DnVz19r1gtYvIMa9jo25Y9rPPYOTvSGHYOWKSz7bLaIM"}],"organizations":[]},"investors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[{"slug":"8-decimal-capital","name":"8 Decimal Capital","logo":null,"description":"8 Decimal Capital is a multi-strategy investment firm focused on both token and equity investment.

The ICO tokens were priced at $2 each for an initial distribution of 30M NAS (35M including investor sale). The token is based on the Ethereum platform and only ETH was accepted for the token sale. There were two bonus tiers associated with the sale, a 5% bonus for a 1000ETH contribution and a 10% bonus for a 3000ETH contribution. There was also a 5M NAS bonus program that served as an incentive to lock up the Ethereum based token in exchange for the Nebulas mainnet token which will be launching early 2018. The cap for this program was 5M tokens, with a reward of 100% for the lockup (an extra 5M tokens). The max supply of NAS is fixed at 100M.\n\nMining NAS has a fixed inflation rate of 4% of max supply, with 1% of the rewards going to the developer incentive program and 3% going to the bookkeepers. The developer incentive program is responsible for rewarding NAS to the developers who create popular and highly liquid applications, and the bookkeepers are essentially the miners of this network; responsible for verifying transactions and liquidity on the network.","general_emission_type":null,"precise_emission_type":null,"is_capped_supply":null,"max_supply":null},"consensus":{"consensus_details":null,"general_consensus_mechanism":"Other","precise_consensus_mechanism":null,"targeted_block_time":15,"block_reward":null,"mining_algorithm":"n/a","next_halving_date":null,"is_victim_of_51_percent_attack":false}},"native_treasury":{"accounts":[],"treasury_usage_details":null}},"technology":{"overview":{"technology_details":"Nebulas Rank:\n\tNebulas Rank is what the team calls their ranking algorithm, used to judge how effectively a person or dApp is contributing to an ecosystem. Their ranking system is based on three separate dimensions, liquidity, propagation, and interoperability. Liquidity is the frequency and scale of transactions that pass through a particular address. In terms of propagation, they are referring to “the scope and depth of asset liquidity”. Interoperability is judged by the prevalence of an address across other blockchains. This is less relevant today as there is limited interoperability among any blockchains, however it will become more significant over time. The ranking algorithm is based off of LeaderRank using transaction data taken straight from the blockchain. LeaderRank is a variant of PageRank used specifically in social networks that identifies users spreading useful items (in this case dApps).\n\t\nNebulas Force:\n\tNebulas Force is the term used to describe the evolutionary capabilities that the Nebulas blockchain possesses. Force is made up of three components, the NVM, protocol upgrades, and smart contract upgrades. In Nebulas there is less need for hard or soft forks. Similar to Tezos, users are allowed to vote on proposals to upgrade the protocol and if passed, the proposals are then written into code by the core developers and implemented through a transaction. This is possible because the protocol code is implemented into the block structure, i.e. you can gradually adjust the ranking algorithm over time without redoing the core structure of the blockchain. The process involves replacing the old bytecode of the NVM compiler with a new bytecode, essentially replacing the interpreter. The structure is similar for upgrading the smart contract functionality on the platform. \n\nDeveloper Incentive Protocol:\n\tThe Developer Incentive Protocol (DIP) is a reward algorithm that incentivizes developers to create useful smart contracts by giving them Nebulas tokens. The higher the number and quality of users that are interacting with a smart contract, the more tokens are sent to the owner. This is carried out once a week to ensure accuracy. To prevent cheating within this protocol the founders have made it unfeasibly costly to improve your rank through address fraud. \n\nProof-of-Devotion:\nThe final significant unique aspect of the Nebulas blockchain is its proof-of-devotion consensus algorithm. The principle behind this new algorithm is to disempower large miners with the ability to outspend their peers in capital expenditure in order to control significant portions of the blockchain. Instead, proof-of-devotion selects block leaders by calculating the rank of each account and assigning a leadership probability based on this ranking. This theoretically adjusts the power of controlling the network to those with the most effort invested in it.\n","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":null,"onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":"Upcoming","onchain_governance_details":null,"is_treasury_decentralized":false},"grants":[]},"metadata":{"updated_at":"2018-10-16T18:24:38Z"}}},{"id":"0c7afd5c-7131-4140-99fc-19437c965ec4","symbol":"DMT","name":"DMarket","slug":"dmarket","_internal_temp_agora_id":"9563dbec-2714-4b83-acab-59d6e8a0e39e","metrics":{"market_data":{"price_usd":0.6172654142313162,"price_btc":0.000010777468761984121,"price_eth":0.0003491854130061977,"volume_last_24_hours":60253112.89024094,"real_volume_last_24_hours":59965.70296076721,"volume_last_24_hours_overstatement_multiple":1004.7929051988563,"percent_change_usd_last_1_hour":null,"percent_change_usd_last_24_hours":null,"percent_change_btc_last_24_hours":null,"percent_change_eth_last_24_hours":null,"ohlcv_last_1_hour":{"open":0.6417975895371768,"high":0.6426803963173974,"low":0.6173938241362052,"close":0.6173938241362052,"volume":723.5407023294514},"ohlcv_last_24_hour":{"open":0.5720792377377203,"high":0.7086658229980077,"low":0.5681490053523817,"close":0.6172654142313162,"volume":63716.762023760064},"last_trade_at":"2021-03-12T19:10:28.79Z"},"marketcap":{"marketcap_dominance_percent":0.0020215923035830086,"current_marketcap_usd":35187434.67185397,"y_2050_marketcap_usd":null,"y_plus10_marketcap_usd":null,"liquid_marketcap_usd":null,"realized_marketcap_usd":null,"volume_turnover_last_24_hours_percent":null},"supply":{"y_2050":null,"y_plus10":null,"liquid":null,"circulating":56921772.80947897,"y_2050_issued_percent":null,"annual_inflation_percent":null,"stock_to_flow":null,"y_plus10_issued_percent":null},"blockchain_stats_24_hours":{"count_of_active_addresses":null,"transaction_volume":null,"adjusted_transaction_volume":null,"adjusted_nvt":null,"median_tx_value":null,"median_tx_fee":null,"count_of_tx":null,"count_of_payments":null,"new_issuance":null,"average_difficulty":null,"kilobytes_added":null,"count_of_blocks_added":null},"market_data_liquidity":{"clearing_prices_to_sell":null,"marketcap":null,"asset_bid_depth":null,"usd_bid_depth":null,"updated_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"},"all_time_high":{"price":1.0848984252969665,"at":"2018-03-28T16:00:00Z","days_since":1080,"percent_down":38.5808062926081,"breakeven_multiple":1.6281555319076884},"cycle_low":{"price":0.04744603414335009,"at":"2019-09-27T04:00:00Z","percent_up":1299.4273476389053,"days_since":532},"token_sale_stats":{"sale_proceeds_usd":19026678,"sale_start_date":"2017-11-03","sale_end_date":"2017-12-01","roi_since_sale_usd_percent":16.735371735089803,"roi_since_sale_btc_percent":-88.78752031017441,"roi_since_sale_eth_percent":null},"staking_stats":{"staking_yield_percent":null,"staking_type":null,"staking_minimum":null,"tokens_staked":null,"tokens_staked_percent":null,"real_staking_yield_percent":null},"mining_stats":{"mining_algo":null,"network_hash_rate":null,"available_on_nicehash_percent":null,"1_hour_attack_cost":null,"24_hours_attack_cost":null,"attack_appeal":null,"mining_revenue_native":null,"mining_revenue_usd":null,"average_difficulty":null},"developer_activity":{"stars":null,"watchers":null,"commits_last_3_months":0,"commits_last_1_year":0,"lines_added_last_3_months":0,"lines_added_last_1_year":0,"lines_deleted_last_3_months":0,"lines_deleted_last_1_year":0},"roi_data":{"percent_change_last_1_week":32.35966193511316,"percent_change_last_1_month":116.46319535230303,"percent_change_last_3_months":303.68864988548023,"percent_change_last_1_year":1085.8396585692728,"percent_change_btc_last_1_week":12.513702854719625,"percent_change_btc_last_1_month":69.1068889965027,"percent_change_btc_last_3_months":32.34660380467609,"percent_change_btc_last_1_year":-0.7619782149694623,"percent_change_eth_last_1_week":13.79300411282411,"percent_change_eth_last_1_month":112.00474312407655,"percent_change_eth_last_3_months":28.965493209763192,"percent_change_eth_last_1_year":-27.96504005924232,"percent_change_month_to_date":79.22824009154048,"percent_change_quarter_to_date":239.8901797586841,"percent_change_year_to_date":239.8901797586841},"roi_by_year":{"2020_usd_percent":52.31011377566923,"2019_usd_percent":-58.299707493442746,"2018_usd_percent":-75.23261164549692,"2017_usd_percent":0,"2016_usd_percent":0,"2015_usd_percent":0,"2014_usd_percent":0,"2013_usd_percent":0,"2012_usd_percent":0,"2011_usd_percent":0},"risk_metrics":{"sharpe_ratios":{"last_30_days":-1.1846089263286594,"last_90_days":-3.0728230573171653,"last_1_year":-0.42745321929555163,"last_3_years":0.11245475479563019},"volatility_stats":{"volatility_last_30_days":2.218591827177057,"volatility_last_90_days":2.0252463796458064,"volatility_last_1_year":1.469341990052745,"volatility_last_3_years":2.606076715131481}},"misc_data":{"private_market_price_usd":null,"vladimir_club_cost":2591.465896909717,"btc_current_normalized_supply_price_usd":1.391698861659878,"btc_y2050_normalized_supply_p

","official_links":[]},"background":{"background_details":"Qash is the native token for a large suite of products that Quoine is hoping to develop. Quoine is a licensed crypto exchange based in Japan with operations dating back to 2014. The team developed QASH in attempt to increase liquidity in the token markets and create a more institutional focused platform. Quoine believes that their token can build a global network of liquidity by acting as a base asset and incentivizing external exchanges to participate by rewarding them with QASH. The token will also be used to pay for various services on the platform.\n\nQuoine describes its target market for this product as “underserved markets”; small markets that in isolation are not yet big enough to support a liquid token. Using the platform’s Worldbook system, small exchanges can place an order which will then be exchanged and transferred across QUOINE’s network of order books. This will provide access to tokens that would previously have been unavailable to clients of small institutions due to capital requirements. In a sense, it functions as a cross-exchange exchange, in a similar way to how Polkadot is looking to be a cross-blockchain exchange.\n\nA larger suite of financial products will be built through the Prime Brokerage, which will provide ancillary services to institutions. This platform is purported to provide value to users by reducing counterparty risk, increasing capital efficiency, and netting token positions. The exchange will assume all counterparty risk on the part of consumers, and the liquid platform will reduce fees and improve capital efficiency by allowing instant trade among parties. The alternative would be a roundabout process requiring multiple trades. This brokerage will also include direct market access to various exchanges and fiat money management for customers looking to make their first investments. In total, Quoine is looking to create a comprehensive suite of cryptocurrency financial services that will ultimately drive usage of its QASH token.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[{"slug":"liquid","name":"Liquid","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/FAwaVwW3_400x400.jpg","description":"Liquid (previously named Quoine and Quoinex) is a Singaporean online digital asset exchange platform.\n"}]},"advisors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[]},"investors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[{"slug":"8-decimal-capital","name":"8 Decimal Capital","logo":null,"description":"8 Decimal Capital is a multi-strategy investment firm focused on both token and equity investment.

These technologies work in unison to provide the architecture of the liquidity solution that Quoine is developing, and each is currently in use through the services that have already launched.\n\nThe ME supports core functions of the Qryptos exchange that and was developed to support traditional finance levels of exchange. The team claims that the ME can support several millions of transactions per second which would make it one of the most advanced matching engines in the industry. This engine supports many of the typical architectural interfaces you would find in web development, including a Rest API and WebSocket, but also finance specific interfaces such as the FIX API. They institute each exchange as a separate state machine that acts independently and completes orders through the order matching process.\n\nThe CCCE is a mechanism for allowing the near-instant and automated conversion of different types of currency. This is possible even if the bid and ask orders do not match currency types, as well as across fiat currency and tokens. In the event that the fiat currencies requested differ a standard foreign exchange rate is used to equate value, and in the event that the tokens requested differ a cryptocurrency conversion rate is applied. In this respect, the CCCE functions as a comprehensive foreign exchange platform in which value can be transferred between traders quickly and seamlessly without a specific liquidity silo preventing exchange from occurring. \n\nFinally, SOR is designed to maintain low-latency and real-time feeds for all major exchanges throughout the world. When an order is placed into the Worldbook and it cannot be filled internally by the Qryptos exchange, it is then sent out to all other exchanges hooked into the Worldbook system. It does this by not only checking for perfect matches but also for FX matches that can be completed using the CCCE.\n\nThe combination of these three technologies focus on maintaining a pool of liquidity that manages both fiat and cryptocurrencies efficiently across a global orderbook.","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":null,"onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":"Delegated

blockchain. The project builds off the same technological innovations pioneered by the Bitcoin Lightning Network by facilitating transactions off-chain, but focuses on support for all ERC-20 compliant tokens. Participants will transaction directly through payment channels without needing to settle transactions on the blockchain, helping to avoid bottlenecks related to processing numerous and often small payment transactions. Users hedge themselves against counterparty risk by swapping cryptographic \"promissory notes\" that can be pushed to the Ethereum blockchain if circumstances require. Invalidation of previous notes when new ones are created prevents any party from gaming the system.\n\nAt first, the system might not be very appealing unless two participants plan to remunerate very frequently, since opening a new channel requires locking up assets via an on-chain broadcasted transaction. To alleviate this, the team plans to integrate the ability to route channels deterministically through multiple parties. Users having unique channels with many participants means less money in their wallets for discretionary spending, significantly reducing the versatility of their funds. Raiden plans to alleviate these concerns by introducing an effective pathfinding algorithm between network participants. If the relationship between users is extremely isolated, the system can keep introducing more intermediaries to form a lineage robust enough to facilitate payments.\n\nThe network plans to use the Raiden Network token (RDN) to transmit payments more conveniently for end users, while simultaneously offering incentive structures for liquidity providers and full node operators. While the token is not a functional requirement for the system, the team hopes it can provide incentives for network participants. For example, light clients that don't want to run full stack nodes can send small fees in the form of RDN to peripheral service providers (i.e. pathfinding and monitoring services) as compensation for utilizing their infrastructure. The token's primary utility will be for these pathfinding and monitoring services. By design, participants area incentivized to relay these peripheral fees using RDN (compared to Ether or other ERC-20 tokens) due to lower transaction costs.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[{"slug":"brainbot-technologies-ag","name":"Brainbot Technologies AG","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1558569600%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DA3gsYNyuvE7ZNMNmIuHMERFdjPPaEIF-8WzfNDEI2Bs","description":"A blockchain development studio creating the scaling technologies for broad adoption of public blockchain systems"}]},"advisors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[]},"investors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[{"slug":"8-decimal-capital","name":"8 Decimal Capital","logo":null,"description":"8 Decimal Capital is a multi-strategy investment firm focused on both token and equity investment.

The process starts when two parties initiate an opening transaction by depositing tokens to a multi-signature escrow. The process collateralizes the channel and once collateralized, the parties can transact infinitely in both directions, so long as the balance between the two parties at a given time sums to the balance of the originating deposits.\n\nEach new transaction in a payment channel is unique, and each message creates obligations the recipient must fulfill to redeem the funds. Transactions are always locked in the contract until an arbitrary date and the closing can be initiated by either party whenever. The time it takes to close a channel is a block amount, chosen by the participant who opened the channel. When the two parties advance the state of the channel by signing a new transaction, they also relinquish a secret key that invalidates the previous state. There's no procedure to financially punish dishonest participants, however its mitigated in the form of Monitoring services as well as consensus nodes no longer opening channels with dishonest nodes. It is possible for a participant to cheat if the channel partner goes offline without using a Monitoring service. \n\nRaiden builds off this escrow-like process by applying the rules to a chain of participants, introducing events called multihop or Hash Time Lock transfer. Multihop transfers can create a network of payment channels, which connect any two parties looking to transact, without needing to have a direct channel established between the parties themselves. In this case, inter-channel funds are deposited in hash-locked smart contracts from the payee, through the chain of intermediaries, to the payer. A payee then sends a \"secret\" hashed message to the payer. Redemption of the funds occurs in the reverse direction with the payee identifying funds waiting in escrow after the last multihop transfer and releasing the secret message to the intermediary liquidity provider. Releasing the secret catalyzes two reactions. First, it allows the payee to claim the funds out of the escrow and second, the receipt allows the correspondent to claim the money sitting in escrow. This process continues down the line until every intermediary has been paid, ensuring security across each leg of the channel and an incentive for each intermediary to pass along the cryptographically secured

The company's founders are graduates of PayPal's incubator program. TenX's initial token offering in 2017 raised $34 million in 7 minutes. \n\nThe TenX Product Suite consists of the TenX Card, TenX Wallet, TenX PAY Token and TENX Rewards Token. The card and wallet allow users to spend their cryptocurrencies in a simple and safe way, at more than 40 million points all around the world. The PAY Token is a work-in-progress loyalty program which, in the future, will reward token holders for spending cryptocurrencies using the TenX Card. This will be in addition to future utilities including loyalty benefits and and being integrated within the TenX Wallet as a mode of payment. The TENX Rewards Token is an ERC-20 rewards token on Ethereum with features of ERC-1400. TENX Token holders are rewarded with PAY Tokens based on the company’s financial performance and other relevant factors. \n\nTenX co-founders met at a blockchain meetup in Bangkok in 2014, and founded TenX in June 2015 after winning a Hackathon contest in Singapore following a startup boot camp supported by PayPal. The company was originally called OneBit, as it was focusing only on Bitcoin.\n\nThe co-founders of TenX noticed issues when trying to remit money overseas and believed that blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency payments are the way of payments in the future. They started the company with a vision to have assets on the blockchain, available not only to industry insiders but to any user in the real world. With the emergence of more and more different tokens, a growing number of users and businesses truly struggle to leverage the existing blockchain infrastructure. TenX focuses on making the interconnectedness of physical and virtual platforms a reality.\n","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[{"slug":"tenx","name":"TenX","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1565827200%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DlBqOAKGIuzZkIb1t3CZiX1XUoeTh1r35E1DoDjbJFEM","description":"TenX is a financial services company based in Singapore that builds software to reduce the friction for retail customers and merchants of spending and accepting cryptocurrency.

In Uplive, fans buy virtual gifts designed and created by Uplive’s in-house team of designers with an in-app digital currency called diamonds. GIFTO will decouple the gift creation, curation, and revenue share process from centralized platforms like Uplive and put control in the hands of virtual gift creators, curators, content creators, and fans.\n\nThe transaction flow is expected to work as follows. First, virtual gift creators will design and create virtual gifts (an ERC-721 compliant token). Second, curators will review and approve gifts, making sure they comply with the protocol’s rules and copyright law. Third, content creators will curate a list of approved gifts that their fans can send to them. Fourth, fans purchase GIFTO tokens on cryptocurrency exchange or inside of special wallets like the GIFTO wallet in Uplive. Fifth, fans purchase virtual gifts with their GIFTO tokens and send the gifts to their favorite content creators.\n","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[]},"advisors":{"individuals":[{"slug":"tom-duterme","first_name":"Tom ","last_name":"Duterme","title":"Project Advisor","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1551312000%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DGiDZB2BoM7_DmswM9tAABoS4OQkO-DMvePar0d59LN0"}],"organizations":[]},"investors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[{"slug":"zhi-zi-fund","name":"Zhi Zi Fund","logo":null,"description":"A Blockchain Fund focusing on investing into new disruptive startups and ecosystem platforms.\n"},{"slug":"blockasset-ventures","name":"BlockAsset Ventures","logo":null,"description":"We leverage our years of experience in the digital asset space and our strong industry relationships to co-invest in a portfolio of leading digital assets."},{"slug":"block-vc","name":"Block VC","logo":null,"description":"BlockVC is a leading blockchain investment and digital asset management firm.

Network was created in April 2017, with the mainnet launched in December 2017. The high-level goal of the project is to provide fast and secure Ethereum sidechain, solving the scalability and connectivity issues in existing blockchain ecosystem. POA Network’s vision is to create an ecosystem of multiple networks designed for connectivity using bridges. \n\nPOA offers minimal transaction costs and faster transactions processing, compared to Ethereum. Their bridging technology allows users to bridge their tokens easily from one blockchain to another and back again, as well as converting their own POA Native Tokens from the POA Network onto the Ethereum network. POA offers both their own explorer and wallet, and has implemented on-chain governance. \n\nPOA Network allows for standalone networks to be launched with separate set of validators based on their governance system and trusted ceremony.\n\nThe network was launched in 2017 by the founding team and is currently run by the set of validators, voted in through the on-chain governance system. Project’s technical lead, Igor Barinov, is a developer and serial entrepreneur, who previously co-founded Block Notary, a notary service built on blockchain technology, which is used by a number of American and European banks. \n","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[{"slug":"igor-barinov","first_name":"Igor","last_name":"Barinov","title":"Technical Lead","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*WquqctJ71MZC9k9u8WBdxg.jpeg"},{"slug":"andrew-cravenho","first_name":"Andrew ","last_name":"Cravenho","title":"Project Lead","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/17620007?s=400\u0026v=4"},{"slug":"ziggy-zeidan","first_name":"Ziggy","last_name":"Zeidan","title":"Community Manager","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/member/b/9/5/a/highres_277427450.jpeg"},{"slug":"sky-minert","first_name":"Sky","last_name":"Minert","title":"Partnerships Team Lead","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1557360000%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3Df1co4TDayZSdgC5R8zY5ZsrXMIf9B2CzZcIae7jDLEA"},{"slug":"andreas-fackler","first_name":"Andreas ","last_name":"Fackler","title":"Rust Team Lead","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/7894725?s=400\u0026v=4"},{"slug":"alex-kolotov","first_name":"Alex","last_name":"Kolotov","title":"","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://goo.gl/images/u1dMfz"},{"slug":"viktor-baranov","first_name":"Viktor","last_name":"Baranov","title":"","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQEuLAFBQyp8nw/profile-displayphoto-shrink_200_200/0?e=1545264000\u0026v=beta\u0026t=avJQlzqXeUECwsP3YnWdBws4lSNDxhlG2a4RKVX4M18"},{"slug":"vadim-arasev","first_name":"Vadim","last_name":"Arasev","title":"Solidity dApps Developer at POA Network","description":"Solidity dApps Developer at POA Network","avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1550707200%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3Dukb76kgS7wNuoJ_XKZfvyoBz6wiE7PDIomb67G9Ggdo"}],"organizations":[]},"advisors":{"individuals":[{"slug":"william-mougayar","first_name":"William","last_name":"Mougayar","title":"Board Member at Kin","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1555545600%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DYrYIUk4578YpEpow5IuXKeUEtmakCqc-0o9cvDxm0bw"},{"slug":"mark-pui","first_name":"Mark","last_name":"Pui","title":"","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTOykszETqld5zicgps8wSeTipSxepK8UE5fXzt5Ux8neURPnEV"},{"slug":"david-thelander","first_name":"David","last_name":"Thelander","title":"","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://www.google.com/url?sa=i\u0026source=imgres\u0026cd=\u0026cad=rja\u0026uact=8\u0026ved=2ahUKEwiG34265NneAhWS8oMKHWzWC1EQjRx6BAgBEAU\u0026url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravelshea.com%2Four-team%2Fspecial-counsel%2Fdavid-j-thelander%2Fdavid-thelander%2F\u0026psig=AOvVaw0tYA2ZC4-QXt4ne_geaiWQ\u0026ust=1542487659386357"}],"organizations":[]},"investors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[{"slug":"coinstelegram-fund","name":"Coinstelegram Fund","logo":null,"description":"Coinstelegram fund is an investment firm focused exclusively on ventures, tokens, and projects related to blockchain tech, digital currency, and crypto assets."},{"slug":"sailor-capital","name":"Sailor Capital","logo":null,"description":"Sailor Capital, founded in Hong Kong, headquartered in Beijing, is an early block chain Project Token Fund focusing on investment.

A list of validators is managed by a smart contract with governance by validators. During an initial ceremony, master of ceremony distributed keys to 12 independent validators. They added 12 plus one more to reach initial requirements for the consensus. Independent U.S. public notaries with active commission license are the first validators in POA Network. A concerned third party can cross-validate validators' identities using open data sources and ensure that each validator is a good actor with no criminal records. In the Proof-of-Authority network, identity of individual validator and trust to independent and non-affiliated participants will secure the consensus.\n\nAura (Authority Round) is one of the Blockchain consensus algorithms available in Parity that is used to secure POA Network. It is capable of tolerating up to 50% of malicious nodes with chain reorganizations possible up to a limited depth, dependent on the number of validators, after which finality is guaranteed. This consensus requires a set of validators to be specified, which determines the list of blockchain addresses which participate in the consensus at each height. Sealing a block is the act of collecting transactions and attaching a header to produce a block.\n\nA block is generated with an average time of 5 seconds. The emission rate for validators is 2.5% for the first year of the network. The network uses disinflation model, and emission will decrease every year. An additional 2.5% is added to support sustainability of the network.\nTherefore, 2.5% of the network supply is generated as a reward for validators to secure the network. And 2.5% of total supply will be distributed to support sustainability. Validators will be able to propose areas of spending:\nburn coins\nhold coins\nspend on R\u0026D Foundation\n\nSustainability emission is governed by decentralized apps.\n\nPOA Network has also introduced cross-chain bridge that serves as a method of transferring POA native tokens from the POA Network to the Ethereum network. The POA to Ethereum transfer results in the creation of a newly minted token on the Ethereum blockchain known as POA20. The user also has the ability to transfer POA20 tokens from the Ethereum network back to the POA Network, which would result in the burning of the POA20 token and subsequent unlocking of the original POA native token on the POA Network. The POA20 token displays the exact same properties as the standard ERC20 token and allows it to be used in all the same places that offer ERC20 compatibility.\n\nPOA Network stack also includes an open-source block explorer tool for the Ethereum ecosystem called BlockScout.

Entries are the raw data that is accepted by the protocol. It can be a private hash or a group of data provided by the user.\n\nFactom employs hash technology, a cryptographic function that converts the digital data into alphanumeric strings. These strings are in the form of digital fingerprints. Factom ensures the security of these hashes in three ways:\n\nProof of Existence: The protocol anchors a hash to the Bitcoin blockchain every 10 minutes. This is the proof of existence method that records the location of all the data added.\n\nProof of Process: The manner and the process of the entry are also recorded. This eliminates the problem of double spending.\n\nProof of Audit: By anchoring the data to the blockchain network, Factom makes the data available for audit at any time.

Compared to credit-based lending (which measures trust based on income), collateralized loans are issued in exchange for cryptoassets stored within a smart contract. Lenders publish the loan terms that they are willing to offer borrowers through Salt’s platform. The borrower chooses which terms they’d like and sends their collateral assets to a multi-sig wallet. Lender then posts the cash funds and sends them to the borrower’s account. Borrower makes monthly payments through the duration of the loan, and upon re-payment the funds are returned. If the portfolio value of a borrower drops below a specified threshold, a call notice is sent to the borrower notifying them additional funds are needed. If the borrower fails to re-collateralize, a portion of their portfolio is automatically liquidated to re-balance the over-collateralized loan.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[]},"advisors":{"individuals":[{"slug":"erik-voorhees","first_name":"Erik","last_name":"Voorhees","title":"Founder \u0026 CEO at ShapeShift","description":"Mr. Erik Voorhees founded ShapeShift AG and serves as its Chief Executive Officer.

Three signatures (at minimum) are required before liquidation occurs.\n\nThe SALT (SALT) utility token is used to provide access to products, services, and rewards through SALT's \"Proof of Access\" model. Tokens can be stored on the lending platform in exchange for preferential loan terms such as lower interest rates, higher borrowing limits, and longer payment terms.

Particl is a privacy platform by design, utilizing technology such as ring signatures, default private transactions, encrypted data, secure messaging and IP address anonymization. The Native token (PART) is intended to work as a privacy coin and as the fuel to run DApps on Particl.\n\nThe Particl project team has prioritized an initial DApp, an entirely autonomous and distributed e-commerce marketplace that is governed by a proof of stake mechanism. This private platform will be a person-to-person, EBay-style marketplace that is self governed by its community of token holders.\n\nPrivacy based platform tokens have a difficult history. Where projects prioritize privacy, the question follows whether these projects enable the development of dark net markets where criminals conduct commerce. A predecessor project, ShadowCash, was abandoned in early 2017 due to the general perception that this project would facilitate trade in illicit goods.  \n\nA set of developers from ShadowCash decided to launch Particl as an entirely new and separate project, including lead developer Ryno Mathee. The Particl project team has stated that the intention is not to facilitate trade in illicit goods and that a clean break from ShadowCash is necessary to avoid preconceptions on the goals of the Particl project. However, given that the intention is to build a marketplace with a focus on privacy and that entirely private listings will be possible on the network, it’s unlikely that it will be possible to eliminate the potential for trade in illicit materials in PART.

For the first five days, each additional 0.15 PART could be purchased for $0.15 (equating to $1 per PART) and thereafter the price of each additional 15% interest in PART would increase for the remainder of the token conversion period. Ultimately 5.1 million SOC out of a total SOC supply of 6.6 million was converted into PART and an additional 590 BTC was raised, equating at the time to an average price of $1.50 per additional PART. \n\nThe total initial supply of PART was approximately 8.6 million 1.

This allows for three benefits; lower fees, faster transaction times and better scalability. The Particl community will have the option going forward to add any new functionality that is developed for the BTC blockchain.\n\nPART can be transacted in three possible privacy states, each with their own degree of privacy and with higher transaction costs for greater privacy. Public transactions are pseudo-anonymous in the same way as bitcoin. Blind transactions hide transaction amounts from anyone but the transaction participants and those they designate. Anonymous transactions use the RingCT privacy protocol that is used by Monero, where both the transaction amount and the identities of all transacting parties is hidden. Users will have two balances of PART tokens; a public balance which is used for publicly transacted coins and a private balance for blind and anonymous transacted coins.\n\nOn the Particl marketplace, the intention is to facilitate the use of any cryptocurrency as payment for goods via atomic swaps or the integration of distributed exchanges.  However, all staking and escrow transactions will be paid for in PART.\n\nEach product listing is stored as a message on the blockchain, with most of the metadata (images, product specifications, etc) stored off-chain on a data storage network (DSN) such as IPFS, BitMessage or TOR.  Particl is intended to be protocol agnostic, meaning that any DSN could be used to store data for a product listing.\n\nTransacting parties will not know each other until the purchaser has signaled their interest in a product by messaging the seller.  Thereafter, the buyer and seller enter a private negotiation where the reputations of both parties is made visible and a certain amount of PART is staked by each party in escrow depending on their reputations. This is intended to compel both parties to transact honestly, via the game theoretic principle of mutually assured destruction where they both lose if the transaction goes

is attempting to build a decentralized credit system called the Bloom protocol. The team plans to create an entire credit system including identity, credit scores, and credit cards for unbanked individuals and regions that lack robust credit infrastructure. \n\nThe platform is designed for any lender, whether it be digital assets or fiat currencies, to evaluate the creditworthiness of borrowers without traditional credit scores. Bloom is creating own credit score for the platform called a Bloom score.\n\nBloom plans to incorporate an identity attestation system where the participants of the network manage identity creation. A user’s identity can be verified by existing providers, like a credit bureau or identity service, or by peers, such as friends or family. Bloom token holders will be able to invite new users to the platform and vouch for their identity or character by “staking” their reputation. If a user vouches for someone that ultimately defaults on a debt that user will see their Bloom score decline. Likewise, if users stake individuals that pay back debts on time they will see an increase in their score. In addition, the platform will provide a credit registry to track repayment of debts and a credit scoring system.\n","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[{"slug":"ryan-faber","first_name":"Ryan","last_name":"Faber","title":"Co-founder at Bloom","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%253Fe%253D1553731200%2526v%253Dbeta%2526t%253DzR28zYJkaELSEYsf4YrztQuMgT69h7J_BtT_oY-MU_4"},{"slug":"alain-meier","first_name":"Alain","last_name":"Meier","title":"Co-founder at Bloom","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1553731200%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3DFxwxnWe1JS3-vMEZZKrzJ1QNOAa198FLtP7G-48_fr8"},{"slug":"john-backus","first_name":"John","last_name":"Backus","title":"CTO at Cognito","description":null,"avatar_url":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1555545600%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3D8dZZJoNpWoXpEusHxCpe30FO9QLHveTOmcNm96n4r08"},{"slug":"jesse-leimgruber","first_name":"Jesse","last_name":"Leimgruber","title":"Co-founder","description":"Jesse is currently a Thiel Fellow, as well as graduate of FOUNDER.org and The Alchemist Accelerator.

The goal is to create a decentralized protocol for credit tracking and scoring allowing credit scorers, lenders, and borrowers to get a comprehensive view of consumers’ creditworthiness. There are three core technologies that will power the Bloom protocol; BloomID, BloomIQ, and BloomScore. \n\nBloomID is an identity management system for the Bloom protocol, providing a unique ID not tied to existing identifiers like social security numbers. To verify new users the platform will rely on existing outside identity providers to attest to a users identity. These providers will be required to go through an application process, and once approved can verify identities, through name, date of birth, and address, in return for Bloom tokens. Verified users will then be able to build up a reusable identity by referencing previously validated identities in their credit applications, referring to the users’ public key. \n\nIndividual users will also be able to verify the details of users, such as the birth date of a friend, by staking a small number of tokens. After a year passes, these tokens will be returned to the verifying individual. Bloom plans to use this as a method to prevent fraudulent actors from spamming the network with fake users and having those users verify the identity of other fraudulent users.\n\nBloomIQ is a system for reporting and tracking current and historical debt obligations for a specific BloomID. It is designed to take external sources of information such as traditional credit scores and augment them with blockchain based information from Bloom’s partners and Bloom’s credit card, BloomCard. Unlike traditional credit scoring systems his information will be provided to the lender upon a user application, but unless the user has already had a loan with this institution, they will not provide specific details on loan balances, payment amounts, and other specific credit data. Loan providers may, however, request more information through a risk assessment provider who will then be responsible for gathering more information, performing attestation, and then staking collateral to this loan to ensure accuracy.\n\nBloomScore is a comprehensive credit score based on all data available for a specific BloomID analyzed using multiple scoring phases. The initial score will be in a range of 0 – 100, with each phase responsible for a portion of the score. Phase one will be for new users who have not participated long in the network and will be scored 0 – 20  based on how many stakes they have established. These stakes are the identity attestations as mentioned in BloomID. Once a user has added eight or more stakes they will achieve a score of 20. Scoring phase two will be an aggregate of the BloomScores of the participants that the user has staked, with a range of 0 – 30. If the user has only staked other users with high BloomScores, they will achieve a score of 30 in this phase and reach the total score of 50. Finally, in phase three, the users’ individual credit history will be assessed. This will include such information as longest repayment history, average payment total per month, number of past loans, and total amount paid across all reported information. This phase will be responsible for the back half of the 100 points, allowing users to reach the final maximum score of 100. \n\nThe platform uses the Bloom Token (BLT), which serves a number of roles. As the network currency, identity attesters and risk assessors will set their prices and receive payment for their services in BLT. It will furthermore serve as a proposal mechanism for making changes to the BloomScore phases and algorithms. Additionally, it will be used as a way of accrediting attesters, with organizations looking to be included paying BLT and attesters voting on the organization’s inclusion receiving it. Lastly, in the early phase of the project, an invitation system for new users will be in place which will require to stake BLT as collateral to avoid the mass-scale set-up of malicious accounts.\n\nThe Bloom team has also launched its own blockchain credit card, BloomCard, built on the Bloom protocol. It’s an Ethereumbased credit card that allows any user to get credit regardless of their access to a bank account or historical credit profile. This card is also key in bootstrapping their BloomIQ product. By gathering credit data from the users ofthis card, Bloom will have a fundamental base of credit history to gauge creditworthiness among the BloomIDs. It is not the intention for Bloom to become a large-scale credit provider and the card is more intended as an example for other lenders.","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":null,"onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":null,"onchain_governance_details":null,"is_treasury_decentralized":null},"grants":[]},"metadata":{"updated_at":"2021-02-17T19:52:37Z"}}},{"id":"a6b844e1-2c13-49fc-8f5c-37102c0ebec6","symbol":"ENG","name":"Enigma","slug":"enigma","_internal_temp_agora_id":"b2d9a067-f8db-471f-91c1-7cc19b03be78","metrics":{"market_data":{"price_usd":0.19607425308434825,"price_btc":0.0000034236971544203862,"price_eth":0.00011067953658781283,"volume_last_24_hours":2281.14054574,"real_volume_last_24_hours":2653.983464294111,"volume_last_24_hours_overstatement_multiple":0.8595157341519921,"percent_change_usd_last_1_hour":null,"percent_change_usd_last_24_hours":1.8029835999466233,"percent_change_btc_last_24_hours":1.0747770365460312,"percent_change_eth_last_24_hours":3.1218146628524117,"ohlcv_last_1_hour":{"open":0.1956601609528311,"high":0.1956601609528311,"low":0.1956601609528311,"close":0.1956601609528311,"volume":25.798244114425312},"ohlcv_last_24_hour":{"open":0.18962649460044548,"high":0.20528430120002775,"low":0.1842474460709652,"close":0.19607425308434825,"volume":2545.702237427257},"last_trade_at":"2021-03-12T17:26:59.28Z"},"marketcap":{"marketcap_dominance_percent":0.0001579623397543545,"current_marketcap_usd":2743670.45461726,"y_2050_marketcap_usd":null,"y_plus10_marketcap_usd":null,"liquid_marketcap_usd":null,"realized_marketcap_usd":58661672.94538028,"volume_turnover_last_24_hours_percent":null},"supply":{"y_2050":null,"y_plus10":null,"liquid":null,"circulating":13993017.499533573,"y_2050_issued_percent":null,"annual_inflation_percent":null,"stock_to_flow":null,"y_plus10_issued_percent":null},"blockchain_stats_24_hours":{"count_of_active_addresses":13,"transaction_volume":4918.685570273297,"adjusted_transaction_volume":3012.475981381943,"adjusted_nvt":10860.050691504312,"median_tx_value":89.40094400239892,"median_tx_fee":null,"count_of_tx":9,"count_of_payments":9,"new_issuance":null,"average_difficulty":null,"kilobytes_added":null,"count_of_blocks_added":null},"market_data_liquidity":{"clearing_prices_to_sell":null,"marketcap":null,"asset_bid_depth":null,"usd_bid_depth":null,"updated_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"},"all_time_high":{"price":8.106911838531168,"at":"2018-01-11T01:00:00Z","days_since":1156,"percent_down":97.57966328312312,"breakeven_multiple":41.31656529552513},"cycle_low":{"price":0.07011064484420255,"at":"2020-03-16T11:00:00Z","percent_up":179.8641551063017,"days_since":361},"token_sale_stats":{"sale_proceeds_usd":45000000,"sale_start_date":"2017-09-11","sale_end_date":"2017-09-11","roi_since_sale_usd_percent":-61.32638103819287,"roi_since_sale_btc_percent":-97.08041384625164,"roi_since_sale_eth_percent":null},"staking_stats":{"staking_yield_percent":1,"staking_type":null,"staking_minimum":null,"tokens_staked":null,"tokens_staked_percent":null,"real_staking_yield_percent":null},"mining_stats":{"mining_algo":null,"network_hash_rate":null,"available_on_nicehash_percent":null,"1_hour_attack_cost":null,"24_hours_attack_cost":null,"attack_appeal":null,"mining_revenue_native":null,"mining_revenue_usd":null,"average_difficulty":null},"developer_activity":{"stars":null,"watchers":null,"commits_last_3_months":0,"commits_last_1_year":0,"lines_added_last_3_months":0,"lines_added_last_1_year":0,"lines_deleted_last_3_months":0,"lines_deleted_last_1_year":0},"roi_data":{"percent_change_last_1_week":16.83791893927592,"percent_change_last_1_month":50.82819226410543,"percent_change_last_3_months":-70.1299244648605,"percent_change_last_1_year":98.6620113301517,"percent_change_btc_last_1_week":-0.6807156991529396,"percent_change_btc_last_1_month":17.831053566575182,"percent_change_btc_last_3_months":-90.20729700082894,"percent_change_btc_last_1_year":-83.37479703451164,"percent_change_eth_last_1_week":0.44856262105463046,"percent_change_eth_last_1_month":47.721612003267985,"percent_change_eth_last_3_months":-90.45747502513396,"percent_change_eth_last_1_year":-87.93208683441763,"percent_change_month_to_date":3.118982978210208,"percent_change_quarter_to_date":-66.29673132390033,"percent_change_year_to_date":-66.29673132390033},"roi_by_year":{"2020_usd_percent":50.96752262901537,"2019_usd_percent":13.134849920874558,"2018_usd_percent":-91.26867564948786,"2017_usd_percent":606.9755577280083,"2016_usd_percent":0,"2015_usd_percent":0,"2014_usd_percent":0,"2013_usd_percent":0,"2012_usd_percent":0,"2011_usd_percent":0},"risk_metrics":{"sharpe_ratios":{"last_30_days":2.3017717991745013,"last_90_days":-0.32641383024030873,"last_1_year":0.9328517794842943,"last_3_years":0.21034866484134226},"volatility_stats":{"volatility_last_30_days":5.625879117576573,"volatility_last_90_days":3.8655224378024515,"volatility_last_1_year":2.386951072398222,"volatility_last_3_years":1.7805370312478006}},"misc_data":{"private_market_price_usd":null,"vladimir_club_cost":

The protocol originated from CEO Guy Zyskind’s research at MIT in 2015. Enigma acts as a second layer on top of existing blockchains, allowing for computationally intensive or private tasks to be transferred off-chain. Using this structure, nodes can prove they have completed a task without a need to see the underlying data. The team believes this will enable a type of smart contracts where data remains encrypted called “secret contracts.”\n\nThe team believes that a range of use cases can emerge from the protocol including medical research and the ability to prove specific details like creditworthiness or age, without needing to reveal underlying specifics. Because privacy is enforced through a variety of mechanisms, including client-side encryption and distributed off-chain computing, details of individuals are never exposed.\n\nThe network uses three layers; a protocol layer for private data computation, a platform layer that enables the creation of data sharing marketplaces, and an application layer where decentralized applications are built.\n\nCurrently, the platform layer is focused on the Enigma Data Marketplace, which is a smart contract based decentralized infrastructure for buying and selling datasets. Information is stored off-chain by providers and can be purchased using the Enigma (ENG) token. The goal is to eventually allow anyone, including individual users, to offer data through the platform in return for tokens.\n\nThe first application built on Enigma was Catalyst, an algorithmic trading library for cryptoassets.

While simple tasks can be completed on the blockchain more computationally intensive or private tasks are distributed across a network of nodes and processed off-chain. Only a subset of all nodes is assigned the task of processing data to reduce redundancy in storing data and computing tasks. \n\nData is managed through an off-chain distributed hash table (DHT) that stores references to the source of the information. This allows private data to be encrypted on the client side through APIs provided by Enigma. To increase privacy nodes are given only a subset of the overall data and never have access to the complete dataset. \n\nThrough a series of updates Enigma plans to integrate new features over time to expand the protocol and application functionalities.\n\nThe Discover release, scheduled for Q3 2018, aims to introduce a secret contracts engine that will execute all contract code inside trusted environments. Developing a secret contract would be similar to current smart contracts with the addition of specific logic to identify what needs to run privately in Enigma. The Voyager release planned for 2019 is set to introduce a distributed virtual machine to allow users to choose between general-purpose secure multi-party computations.\n\nEnigma plans to finish their roadmap with the Defiant release in 2010, which will allow the Enigma network to operate its own blockchain independent from other networks. This could include moving to a native token from the current Ethereum based token. The Enigma token, ENG, is currently used to pay for data subscription services with plans to use tokens for compensating individual data providers and nodes that offer storage or computational resources.","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":null,"onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":"No

Once the RChain blockchain launches, all of the RHOC tokens will be converted to another token called REV. They will convert on a 1:1 basis and the REV tokens will be the native staking token for the RChain platform. The sale initially was meant to raise a minimum of $10,000,000 and a maximum of $15,000,000, although they ended up raising $31,000,000. The price per token was $.20, however, if you purchased more than $100,000 worth a 10% discount was applied, and if more than $1,000,000 then a 15% discount. In order to participate in the sale, a minimum amount of $50,000 had to be purchased. Accreditation was only necessary if you were a US investor, however, all participants were required to submit a KYC form no matter what nationality. \n\nOriginally, 1,000,000,000 RHOC tokens were created, but on June 17, 2017 a total of 129,336,426 RHOC tokens were burned. Currently, there is now a total amount of 870,663,574 RHOC in existence and no more will be created until at least the REV staking token is available for use on the RChain platform. There is no finalized decision on what the total supply of REV will be. It is subject to change depending on the consensus protocol design they decide to go with. If additional REV are issued in the future, they estimate that the total supply will increase anywhere from 10% to 100%, resulting in a total supply between 958,000,000 and 1,741,000,000 REVs. \n \nThe RChain team also notes that in the future there may also be additional staking tokens added to the network other than REV. They claim there is a strong case for and against the safety of a proof-of-stake network supporting multiple staking tokens. If the Co-op comes to consensus that multiple staking tokens can be implemented safely, there will be others added.

The way it works is if you’d like to participate in consensus on the network, you have to put up a bond, if you try to go against the consensus rules of the network, other validators of the network will notice and slash you, resulting in you losing the initial bond you put up. The central idea behind it is that by not playing by the rules you risk losing the bond you had to put up to participate.\n\nRChain’s architecture is based on a branch of mathematics called mobile process calculi, which has approximately 30 years of history. Reflective Higher-Order Calculus (Rho Calculus) is the computing model that powers RChain. The heart of RChain is the Rho Virtual Machine (RhoVM) Execution Environment. With RhoVM, transactions don’t have to be processed sequentially, but rather concurrency is built into the protocol. Concurrency allows the nodes to share the load and process transactions in parallel, utilizing multiple RhoVMs. This, essentially, creates a structure in which there are multiple blockchains per node. \n\nRChain hopes to avoid explicit routing where all the validators wouldn’t need to know what the entire set of validators are doing or who they are if it doesn’t concern them. Unlike most blockchains where addresses are public keys, RChain’s address space is structured by Namespaces. The Namespaces serve as virtual channels on the network that are independently and concurrently processing transactions. The smart contracts would execute independently and only share data with one another when necessary, meaning they wouldn’t need to watch all transactions in all of the namespaces. Nodes would not have to download the entire blockchain, but rather they’d be able to subscribe to selected address spaces and allow developers to choose the optimal validation path for every transaction. \n\nUse of LADL (Logic as a Distributive Law)\nA form of compression that will allow for more throughput on the blockchain. Most blockchain designs have their blocks contain transactions.  With RChain, rules are included in the blocks instead. These rules define what transactions can be included in that block. This makes it possible for a massive amount of transactions to be represented by a small set of rules. \n\nThe LADL algorithm will also help with detecting possible bugs in contracts before they are deployed. It can generate type system for untyped languages, which makes it possible to write reliable code. Contracts written in RhoLang can detect race conditions. Race conditions occur where an output is dependent on the sequence of other events, and the events do not occur how the programmer intended.  An example of this is with the famous DAO contract bug on Ethereum. If the DAO contract had been written in RhoLang, the bug could’ve been detected and prevented.

Three hundred thousand units of the covert premine were moved out of the shielded pool towards what appear to be exchanges.

The Services layer in the middle will consist of functionality for indexing, payment channel hubs, age verification, advertising and an interface builder. The Applications layer at the top will consist of partner sites, a camsite (including one run by SpankChain themselves) and a content marketplace.\n\nThe core layer is where the smart contracts and infrastructure for the ecosystem reside. It will consist of an Ethereum-based performer registry which can be linked up to IPFS for additional data. It will furthermore have a payment channel contract, using the Machinomy payment channel library and an Ethereum wallet that supports payment channels, Vynos. The infrastructure at this level will be open source and free.\n\nIn contrast, the Services layer will offer paid services. This layer includes the Payment Channel Hub, which is the main economic driver of the platform. It allows for grouped payments to be processed and settled on the blockchain at the end instead of each individual transaction being posted to the blockchain. Other services at this level include age verification, live video streaming infrastructure, an advertising network, affiliate network for the creation of an open market for promotional revenue sharing, an index/search API and an interface builder.\n\nThe Applications layer sits at the top and will consists of user interfaces. An adult content market place is being developed in collaboration with district0x, called The Red Light District and the intention is for third party developers to build apps on the platform. SpankChain will be launching its own cam site as well.\n\nThe SpankChain platform uses two tokens: SPANK and BOOTY. The SPANK token is used for staking and governance. By staking SPANK in the SpankBank staking contract the BOOTY token is earned. This BOOTY token can be used by performers and platform businesses to pay their fees. Users can pay (tip) performers with BOOTY, although it will also be possible to pay in ETH or any other ERC20 token.\n\nThe amount of BOOTY generated and distributed to stakers by the smart contract is dependent and automatically adjusted based on the amount of BOOTY being used in the system. The amount of BOOTY earned by stakers is dependent on the duration of staking.\n\nSpankChain will also introduce Proof-of-Spank. This is a new verification game used to verify that performers are indeed who they are, in order to ensure that they comply with age verification. Every ten minutes a performer is selected at random and has to spank themselves a specific number of times. SPANK stakers can then vote whether the performer indeed matches their profile. In order to continue receiving BOOTY for their staked SPANK, stakers will have to participate in a certain number of votes per month.\n

enables users (primarily enterprise businesses) to develop, test, and deploy applications. The goal here is Blockchain-as-a-Service; simple cloud-based deployment using coding languages that developers are most comfortable with (C# and the .NET framework).\n\nThe Stratis team earn revenue by charging a recurring subscription fee for their BaaS model and for the consulting services they provide. Users can download a Stratis full node from the Microsoft Azure Marketplace since Stratis is a certified Microsoft partner.\n\nIf Stratis succeeds, enterprise users will be able to build any application they’d like and deploy it on their own customized private blockchain, a side chain secured by the Stratis network. Due to the nature of this cloud-based model, users wouldn’t need to maintain the network or clients themselves for storage, infrastructure, or platform needs.\n\nReleases so far include the following:\n      1) Breeze Wallet - For B2B private transactions via a Masternode connection on the Stratis \n                                    network.\n      2) ICO Platform - Deploy an ICO on Azure within minutes (KYC and HD wallets included).\n\n      3) Smart Contracts (currently in alpha) - These execute in C#, Stratis’ base language, unlike \n                                    Ethereum or NEO which execute contracts in bytecode that’s unique to those \n                                    blockchains. This means contracts can be audited by millions of dev’s already \n                                    familiar with C#.\n      4) Stratis Identity - allows users to prove ownership of personal data and digital identities, first by \n                                    creating a unique hash ID that’s stored on the Stratis blockchain and secondly \n                                    by signing in/confirming your identity using social logins.","issuing_organizations":[]},"roadmap":[],"regulation":{"regulatory_details":null,"sfar_score":null,"sfar_summary":null}},"contributors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[]},"advisors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[]},"investors":{"individuals":[],"organizations":[{"slug":"advance-fund","name":"Advance.Fund","logo":null,"description":"We are focused on blockchains, protocols and infrastructural solutions that will lay the foundation for decentralized applications and services, as well as anonymous payment systems."},{"slug":"how-2-ventures","name":"How 2 Ventures","logo":"https://messari.s3.amazonaws.com/images/agora-images/0%3Fe%3D1582156800%26v%3Dbeta%26t%3D9odAaWPPsffHE4lPgbB6X5zoPTADeXYvp-hrFQqzJRc","description":"A Blockchain Venture Capital, Digital Asset \u0026 Cryptocurrency Hedge Fund.

Since the .NET framework is also written with C#, the Stratis platform can run within the Microsoft .NET Framework and common language runtime.\n\nWithin the client tier, each of the following devices connect to the various services in the application tier:  browsers, desktops, along with both mobile and IOT (Internet of Things) devices. Devices receive blockchain data by querying the Stratis Chain API via HTTPS. The application tier is composed of the Stratis Chain API, Cloud Stratis Management portal, Cloud Stratis API and Secure Payment Verification (SPV). Just like the Stratis architecture, all of the components in the application tier are developed in C#. \n\nThe application tier handles Blockchain requests and SPV proofs for Lite clients that do not download the full blockchain. Additionally, access to the Stratis Cloud management portal and API are processed here as well.\n \nThe server tier includes the Stratis full blockchain Node, the Cloud Stratis hosting layer, as well as the Stratis payment protocol. \n\nStratis is a modified fork of the Bitcoin codebase.The network achieves consensus through a Proof-of-Stake model. Full nodes stake a minimum of one Stratis token and are chosen randomly to validate a block every 60 seconds. One token is created with every block for a 0.53% inflation rate. Network updates are developed and released by the Stratis team in London.\n\nThe Stratis token powers the main blockchain and users must spend tokens in order to compute on the network. There is a transaction fee and a gas price involved when you call any Stratis contract. The team aims to ensure that calling any contract will never cost more than $5.00.","client_repositories":[]},"security":{"audits":[],"known_exploits_and_vulnerabilities":[]}},"governance":{"governance_details":null,"onchain_governance":{"onchain_governance_type":"No On-Chain
